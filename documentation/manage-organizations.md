# Manage Organizations

Updated the 15th of October 2024.

If you have a custom instance of the Wallet Provider Backend you have an access to the main dashboard to create different organizations or projects. Each organization is a group of users with a specific wallet configuration.

## Add a new Administrator

Here you can add a new administrator of the wallet provider backend instance.

## Add organizations

You can add a new organization with the email of the admin, first name and last name. An organization is a group of users and a specific wallet configuration. You can for instance create an organization named "Developer" to provide a wallet with as many features as needed and another organization named "Project" for a pilot project with the minimum needed wallet features for the use case.

## Delete an organization

Clic on the organization name in the main Dashboard and delete with confirmation. All data are deleted with no option to undo.
