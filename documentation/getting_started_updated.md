## ðŸ›  Initial Setup

When you open the app for the first time:

1. Click **Create a wallet**
2. Set up your authentication method:
   - PIN code
   - Biometric (face/fingerprint)
   - Or both for 2-factor authentication
3. Read and accept the Terms and Conditions
4. Click **Start** to access "My Wallet"

### Restore an Existing Wallet

You can recover an existing wallet using a passphrase:

- Enter the previously saved recovery phrase (from Talao, Altme, or another compatible wallet)
- This restores your identity (DID), Verifiable Credentials, and (in Altme) crypto account keys

**Note:**
- If you enter the wrong PIN 3 times, the wallet data will be erased
- Always back up your wallet to avoid data loss
- Altme will prompt you to save a recovery phrase when used with crypto assets
