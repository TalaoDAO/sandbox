## Talao FAQ

### What can I do with Talao?

Talao gives users the ability to take back control of their personal information and share it with Web3 or Web2 applications when required. For example, with Talao, users can present an over 18 proof of age to access services for adults only.

### What is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)?

Self-Sovereign Identity, or SSI, are a concept and technology that give users and organizations control over their digital data, without relying on a central authority. SSI allows users to manage and share their data privately and securely, using technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proof and Selective Disclosure to protect privacy.

### How can I use my Talao SSI wallet to manage and share my verifiable credentials?

When you receive a verifiable credential in Talao, it is added to your digital identity. You can use it to prove your identity or access services, like using a membership credential for members-only areas or an 'Over 18' proof for DeFi apps. Use the "scan" button to share credentials via QR code, then accept the request to share.

### What is the level of security of Talao wallet?

Talao wallet is self-custodial and secured with military-grade encryption and biometric authentication. Your data is encrypted and stored on your device, providing enhanced privacy and security. Data are never stored in a central server or a blockchain.

### What does it mean that Talao is "self-custodial"?

A self-custodial wallet (non-custodial) means that your data is encrypted and stored on your device. Only you can access your keys, data, and assets—neither we nor anyone else can. The user is the only owner of his data and keys.

### Where are my digital credentials stored in Talao?

Your digital credentials are encrypted and stored on your phone. For privacy there is no central database, cloud storage or blockchains to store data. This decentralized model is why it’s called "Self-Sovereign Identity" (SSI)—you alone control your data.

### How do I backup my keys and credentials in Talao?

To back up your Talao wallet, write down your passphrase and download your digital credentials on a safe personal storage. If you lose access to your wallet, there’s no way for us to recover it since Talao is self-custodial.

### What are Verifiable Credentials and why are they useful?

Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital claims, representing information like ID cards, proof of age, or crypto address ownership. They are tamper-proof, digitally signed, and instantly verifiable by a third party, making them secure and reliable. This is the new standard for decentralized data used now in many countries in teh world.

### What is 'Selective Disclosure'?

Selective Disclosure allows SSI users to reveal specific pieces of information about their identity without disclosing sensitive data. For example, you can prove you're 'Over 18' without revealing your name or address, enhancing security in online interactions.

## Altme FAQ

### What is the Altme Wallet ?

The Altme wallet is the world's first crypto wallet utilizing Decentralized Identity (DID) technology. It's a fully decentralized, non-custodial wallet for iOS and Android. Altme acts as a gateway to Web 3, enabling users to connect with dApps, manage digital assets, and prove identity, age, liveness, and compliance through verifiable credentials.

### Why is Altme called a Universal wallet and how is it different from other crypto wallets?

Talao is called a 'Universal wallet' because, like a physical wallet that holds ID cards and funds, the Talao wallet gathers digital credentials (ID card, age proof, diploma, etc.) and digital assets (cryptos, NFTs, tokens). The wallet is built on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which allows users to manage digital credentials in a decentralized and privacy-preserving way.

### Are there any risks related to verifying my address to get a 'proof of ownership' in Altme?

No, there is zero risk. You don’t need to share or disclose any passphrase or private keys to get a proof of ownership. Simply scan a QR code with your crypto wallet to receive a credential that proves you hold the private key of the address. Talao wallet is never connected to your crypto wallet.

### How does Off-Chain verification work ?

Once a user's identity is verified, Altme issues cryptographically signed proofs (verifiable credentials) that are re-usable and instantly verifiable. Users can then conveniently share their verified data off-chain via a QR code or link whenever needed.

### How do I backup my keys and verifiable credentials?

To backup your Altme wallet, write down your passphrase (12 words) and download your digital credential files, then store them in a secure location.

### What cryptocurrencies and NFTs are supported by Altme?

Altme supports tokens from several blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Tezos, Fantom, BNB Chain, Etherlink.

### How can I deposit or withdraw funds from my Altme wallet?

You can purchase native coins directly in Altme and send them to your desired blockchain addresses.

### Can I trade cryptocurrencies using Altme?

While you cannot directly trade cryptocurrencies in Altme, you can easily connect your wallet with decentralized exchanges (DEX) to trade any coins.

### Is Altme available in languages other than English?

At this time, Altme is available in English, French, Spanish and Catalan.

### How can I restore my wallet?

You can backup your Altme wallet by using your recovery phrase. Find your recovery phrase by going to “Parameters”, then “Wallet Security”, and finally “Show Wallet Recovery Phrase”.

### What if I lose my recovery phrase?

If you lose your recovery phrase, it is not possible for us to help you retrieve it. It is crucial to keep it in a safe and secure location.
