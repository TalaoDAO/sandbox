1. Introduction

This section is non-normative.

Credentials are integral to our daily lives: driver's licenses confirm our capability to operate motor vehicles; university degrees assert our level of education; and government-issued passports attest to our citizenship when traveling between countries. This specification provides a mechanism for expressing these sorts of credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine verifiable. These credentials provide benefits to us when used in the physical world, but their use on the Web continues to be elusive.

It is currently difficult to express educational qualifications, healthcare data, financial account details, and other third-party-verified personal information in a machine readable way on the Web. The challenge of expressing digital credentials on the Web hinders our ability to receive the same benefits from them that physical credentials provide in the real world.

For those unfamiliar with the concepts related to verifiable credentials, the following sections provide an overview of:

The components that constitute a verifiable credential
The components that constitute a verifiable presentation
An ecosystem where verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations are useful

The use cases and requirements that informed this specification can be found in Verifiable Credentials Use Cases [VC-USE-CASES].

1.1 What is a Verifiable Credential?

This section is non-normative.

In the physical world, a credential might consist of:

Information related to identifying the subject of the credential (for example, a photo, name, or identification number)
Information related to the issuing authority (for example, a city government, national agency, or certification body)
Information related to the type of credential (for example, a Dutch passport, an American driving license, or a health insurance card)
Information related to specific properties asserted by the issuing authority about the subject (for example, nationality, date of birth, or the classes of vehicle they're qualified to drive)
Evidence by which a subject was demonstrated to have satisfied the qualifications required for issuance of the credential (for example, a measurement, proof of citizenship, or test result)
Information related to constraints on the credential (for example, validity period, or terms of use).

A verifiable credential can represent all the same information that a physical credential represents. Adding technologies such as digital signatures can make verifiable credentials more tamper-evident and trustworthy than their physical counterparts.

Holders of verifiable credentials can generate verifiable presentations and then share these verifiable presentations with verifiers to prove they possess verifiable credentials with specific characteristics.

Both verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations can be transmitted rapidly, making them more convenient than their physical counterparts when establishing trust at a distance.

While this specification attempts to improve the ease of expressing digital credentials, it also aims to balance this goal with several privacy-preserving goals. The persistence of digital information, and the ease with which disparate sources of digital data can be collected and correlated, comprise a privacy concern that the use of verifiable and easily machine-readable credentials threatens to make worse. This document outlines and attempts to address several of these issues in Section 8. Privacy Considerations. Examples of how to use this data model using privacy-enhancing technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs, are also provided throughout this document.

The word "verifiable" in the terms verifiable credential and verifiable presentation refers to the characteristic of a credential or presentation as being able to be verified by a verifier, as defined in this document. Verifiability of a credential does not imply the truth of claims encoded therein. Instead, upon establishing the authenticity and currency of a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation, a verifier validates the included claims using their own business rules before relying on them. Such reliance only occurs after evaluating the issuer, the proof, the subject, and the claims against one or more verifier policies.

1.2 Ecosystem Overview

This section is non-normative.

This section describes the roles of the core actors and the relationships between them in an ecosystem where one expects verifiable credentials to be useful. A role is an abstraction that might be implemented in many different ways. The separation of roles suggests likely interfaces and protocols for standardization. This specification introduces the following roles:

holder
A role an entity might perform by possessing one or more verifiable credentials and generating verifiable presentations from them. A holder is often, but not always, a subject of the verifiable credentials they are holding. Holders store their credentials in credential repositories. Example holders include students, employees, and customers.
issuer
A role an entity can perform by asserting claims about one or more subjects, creating a verifiable credential from these claims, and transmitting the verifiable credential to a holder. For example, issuers include corporations, non-profit organizations, trade associations, governments, and individuals.
subject
A thing about which claims are made. Example subjects include human beings, animals, and things.
verifier
A role an entity performs by receiving one or more verifiable credentials, optionally inside a verifiable presentation for processing. Example verifiers include employers, security personnel, and websites.
verifiable data registry
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of identifiers, verification material, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, and so on, which might require using verifiable credentials. Some configurations might require correlatable identifiers for subjects. Some registries, such as ones for UUIDs and verification material, might just act as namespaces for identifiers. Examples of verifiable data registries include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. Often, more than one type of verifiable data registry used in an ecosystem.
Figure 1 The roles and information flows forming the basis for this specification.
NOTE: Other types of ecosystems exist

Figure 1 above provides an example ecosystem to ground the rest of the concepts in this specification. Other ecosystems exist, such as protected environments or proprietary systems, where verifiable credentials also provide benefits.

This ecosystem contrasts with the typical two-party or federated identity provider models. An identity provider, sometimes abbreviated as IdP, is a system for creating, maintaining, and managing identity information for holders while providing authentication services to relying party applications within a federation or distributed network. In a federated identity model, the holder is tightly bound to the identity provider. This specification avoids using "identity provider," "federated identity," or "relying party" terminology, except when comparing or mapping these concepts to other specifications. This specification decouples the identity provider concept into two distinct concepts: the issuer and the holder.

NOTE: Subjects are not always Holders

In many cases, the holder of a verifiable credential is the subject, but in some instances it is not. For example, a parent (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of a child (the subject), or a pet owner (the holder) might hold the verifiable credentials of their pet (the subject). For more information about these exceptional cases, see the Subject-Holder Relationships section in the Verifiable Credentials Implementation Guidelines 1.0.

For a deeper exploration of the verifiable credentials ecosystem and a concrete lifecycle example, please refer to Verifiable Credentials Overview [VC-OVERVIEW].

1.3 Conformance

As well as sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

A conforming document is a compacted JSON-LD document that complies with all of the relevant "MUST" statements in this specification. Specifically, the relevant normative "MUST" statements in Sections 4. Basic Concepts, 5. Advanced Concepts, and 6. Syntaxes of this document MUST be enforced. A conforming document MUST be either a verifiable credential with a media type of application/vc or a verifiable presentation with a media type of application/vp. A conforming document MUST be secured by at least one securing mechanism as described in Section 4.12 Securing Mechanisms.

A conforming issuer implementation produces conforming documents, MUST include all required properties in the conforming documents it produces, and MUST secure the conforming documents it produces using a securing mechanism described in Section 4.12 Securing Mechanisms.

A conforming verifier implementation consumes conforming documents, MUST perform verification on a conforming document as described in Section 4.12 Securing Mechanisms, MUST check that each required property satisfies the normative requirements for that property, and MUST produce errors when non-conforming documents are detected.

This specification includes both required and optional properties. Optional properties MAY be ignored by conforming issuer implementations and conforming verifier implementations.

This document also contains examples that contain characters that are invalid JSON, such as inline comments (//) and the use of ellipsis (...) to denote information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to remove this content if they desire to use the information as a valid document.

NOTE: Human-readable texts in English are illustrative

Examples provided throughout this document include descriptive properties, such as name and description, with values in English to simplify the concepts in each example of the specification. These examples do not necessarily reflect the data structures needed for international use, described in more detail in Section 11. Internationalization Considerations.

2. Terminology

The following terms are used to describe concepts in this specification.

claim
An assertion made about a subject.
credential
A set of one or more claims made by an issuer. The claims in a credential can be about different subjects. The definition of credential used in this specification differs from, NIST's definitions of credential.
decentralized identifier
A portable URL-based identifier, also known as a DID, is associated with an entity. These identifiers are most often used in a verifiable credential and are associated with subjects such that a verifiable credential can be easily ported from one credential repository to another without reissuing the credential. An example of a DID is did:example:123456abcdef. See the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 specification for further details.
default graph
The graph containing all claims that are not explicitly part of a named graph.
entity
Anything that can be referenced in statements as an abstract or concrete noun. Entities include but are not limited to people, organizations, physical things, documents, abstract concepts, fictional characters, and arbitrary text. Any entity might perform roles in the ecosystem, if it can do so. Note that some entities fundamentally cannot take actions, for example, the string "abc" cannot issue credentials.
graph
A set of claims, forming a network of information composed of subjects and their relationship to other subjects or data. Each claim is part of a graph; either explicit in the case of named graphs, or implicit for the default graph.
holder
A role an entity might perform by possessing one or more verifiable credentials and generating verifiable presentations from them. A holder is often, but not always, a subject of the verifiable credentials they are holding. Holders store their credentials in credential repositories.
issuer
A role an entity can perform by asserting claims about one or more subjects, creating a verifiable credential from these claims, and transmitting the verifiable credential to a holder.
named graph
A graph associated with specific properties, such as verifiableCredential. These properties result in separate graphs that contain all claims defined in the corresponding JSON objects.
presentation
Data derived from one or more verifiable credentials issued by one or more issuers that is shared with a specific verifier.
credential repository
Software, such as a file system, storage vault, or personal verifiable credential wallet, that stores and protects access to holders' verifiable credentials.
selective disclosure
The ability of a holder to make fine-grained decisions about what information to share.
unlinkable disclosure
A type of selective disclosure where presentations cannot be correlated between verifiers.
subject
A thing about which claims are made.
validation
The assurance that a claim from a specific issuer satisfies the business requirements of a verifier for a particular use. This specification defines how verifiers verify verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations. It also specifies that verifiers validate claims in verifiable credentials before relying on them. However, the means for such validation vary widely and are outside the scope of this specification. Verifiers trust certain issuers for certain claims and apply their own rules to determine which claims in which credentials are suitable for use by their systems.
verifiable credential
A tamper-evident credential whose authorship can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verifiable.
verifiable data registry
A role a system might perform by mediating the creation and verification of identifiers, verification material, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, and so on, which might require using verifiable credentials. Some configurations might require correlatable identifiers for subjects. Some registries, such as ones for UUIDs and verification material, might act as namespaces for identifiers.
verifiable presentation
A tamper-evident presentation of information encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification. Certain types of verifiable presentations might contain data that is synthesized from, but does not contain, the original verifiable credentials (for example, zero-knowledge proofs).
verification
The evaluation of whether a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation is an authentic and current statement of the issuer or presenter, respectively. This includes checking that the credential or presentation conforms to the specification, the securing mechanism is satisfied, and, if present, the status check succeeds. Verification of a credential does not imply evaluation of the truth of claims encoded in the credential.
verifier
A role an entity performs by receiving one or more verifiable credentials, optionally inside a verifiable presentation for processing. Other specifications might refer to this concept as a relying party.
verification material
Information that is used to verify the security of cryptographically protected information. For example, a cryptographic public key is used to verify a digital signature associated with a verifiable credential.
URL
A Uniform Resource Locator, as defined by the URL Standard. URLs can be dereferenced to result in a resource, such as a document. The rules for dereferencing, or fetching, a URL are defined by the URL scheme. This specification does not use the term URI or IRI because those terms have been deemed to be confusing to Web developers.
3. Core Data Model

This section is non-normative.

The following sections outline core data model concepts, such as claims, credentials, presentations, verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentations, which form the foundation of this specification.

NOTE: The difference between a credential and a verifiable credential

Readers might note that some concepts described in this section, such as credentials and presentations, do not have media types defined by this specification. However, the concepts of a verifiable credential or a verifiable presentation are defined as conforming documents and have associated media types. The concrete difference between these concepts — between credential and presentation vs. verifiable credential and verifiable presentation — is simply the fact that the "verifiable" objects are secured in a cryptographic way, and the others are not. For more details, see Section 4.12 Securing Mechanisms.

3.1 Claims

This section is non-normative.

A claim is a statement about a subject. A subject is a thing about which claims can be made. Claims are expressed using subject- property-value relationships.

Figure 2 The basic structure of a claim.

The data model for claims, illustrated in Figure 2 above, is powerful and can be used to express a large variety of statements. For example, whether someone graduated from a particular university can be expressed as shown in Figure 3 below.

Figure 3 A basic claim expressing that Pat is an alum of "Example University".

Individual claims can be merged together to express a graph of information about a subject. The example shown in Figure 4 below extends the previous claim by adding the claims that Pat knows Sam and that Sam is employed as a professor.

Figure 4 Multiple claims can be combined to express a graph of information.

To this point, the concepts of a claim and a graph of information are introduced. More information is expected to be added to the graph in order to be able to trust claims, more information is expected to be added to the graph.

3.2 Credentials

This section is non-normative.

A credential is a set of one or more claims made by the same entity. Credentials might also include an identifier and metadata to describe properties of the credential, such as the issuer, the validity date and time period, a representative image, verification material, status information, and so on. A verifiable credential is a set of tamper-evident claims and metadata that cryptographically prove who issued it. Examples of verifiable credentials include, but are not limited to, digital employee identification cards, digital driver's licenses, and digital educational certificates.

Figure 5 Basic components of a verifiable credential.

Figure 5 above shows the basic components of a verifiable credential, but abstracts the details about how claims are organized into information graphs, which are then organized into verifiable credentials.

Figure 6 below shows a more complete depiction of a verifiable credential using an embedded proof based on Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0. It is composed of at least two information graphs. The first of these information graphs, the verifiable credential graph (the default graph), expresses the verifiable credential itself through credential metadata and other claims. The second information graph, referred to by the proof property, is the proof graph of the verifiable credential and is a separate named graph. The proof graph expresses the digital proof, which, in this case, is a digital signature. Readers who are interested in the need for multiple information graphs can refer to Section 5.12 Verifiable Credential Graphs.

Figure 6 Information graphs associated with a basic verifiable credential, using an embedded proof based on Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY].

Figure 7 below shows the same verifiable credential as Figure 6, but secured using JOSE [VC-JOSE-COSE]. The payload contains a single information graph, which is the verifiable credential graph containing credential metadata and other claims.

Figure 7 Information graphs associated with a basic verifiable credential, using an enveloping proof based on Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE].
3.3 Presentations

This section is non-normative.

Enhancing privacy is a key design feature of this specification. Therefore, it is crucial for entities using this technology to express only the portions of their personas that are appropriate for given situations. The expression of a subset of one's persona is called a verifiable presentation. Examples of different personas include a person's professional persona, online gaming persona, family persona, or incognito persona.

A verifiable presentation is created by a holder, can express data from multiple verifiable credentials, and can contain arbitrary additional data. They are used to present claims to a verifier. It is also possible to present verifiable credentials directly.

The data in a presentation is often about the same subject but might have been issued by multiple issuers. The aggregation of this information expresses an aspect of a person, organization, or entity.

Figure 8 Basic components of a verifiable presentation.

Figure 8 above shows the components of a verifiable presentation but abstracts the details about how verifiable credentials are organized into information graphs, which are then organized into verifiable presentations.

Figure 9 below shows a more complete depiction of a verifiable presentation using an embedded proof based on Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0. It is composed of at least four information graphs. The first of these information graphs, the verifiable presentation graph (the default graph), expresses the verifiable presentation itself through presentation metadata. The verifiable presentation refers, via the verifiableCredential property, to a verifiable credential. This credential is a self-contained verifiable credential graph containing credential metadata and other claims. This credential refers to a verifiable credential proof graph via a proof property, expressing the proof (usually a digital signature) of the credential. This verifiable credential graph and its linked proof graph constitute the second and third information graphs, respectively, and each is a separate named graph. The presentation also refers, via the proof property, to the presentation's proof graph, the fourth information graph (another named graph). This presentation proof graph represents the digital signature of the verifiable presentation graph, the verifiable credential graph, and the proof graph linked from the verifiable credential graph.

Figure 9 Information graphs associated with a basic verifiable presentation that uses an embedded proof based on Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0.

Figure 10 below shows the same verifiable presentation as Figure 9, but using an enveloping proof based on [VC-JOSE-COSE]. The payload contains only two information graphs: the verifiable presentation graph expressing the verifiable presentation through presentation metadata and the corresponding verifiable credential graph, referred to by the verifiableCredential property. The verifiable credential graph contains a single EnvelopedVerifiableCredential instance referring, via a data: URL [RFC2397], to the verifiable credential secured via an enveloping proof shown in Figure 7.

Figure 10 Information graphs associated with a basic verifiable presentation that is using an enveloping proof based on Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE. The data: URL refers to the verifiable credential shown in Figure 7.
NOTE: Presentations can contain multiple verifiable credentials

It is possible to have a presentation, such as a collection of university credentials, which draws on multiple credentials about different subjects that are often, but not required to be, related. This is achieved by using the verifiableCredential property to refer to multiple verifiable credentials. See Appendix D. Additional Diagrams for Verifiable Presentations for more details.

NOTE: Presentations can be presented by issuers and verifiers

As described in Section 1.2 Ecosystem Overview, an entity can take on one or more roles as they enter a particular credential exchange. While a holder is typically expected to generate presentations, an issuer or verifier might generate a presentation to identify itself to a holder. This might occur if the holder needs higher assurance from the issuer or verifier before handing over sensitive information as part of a verifiable presentation.

4. Basic Concepts

This section introduces some basic concepts for the specification in preparation for Section 5. Advanced Concepts later in the document.

4.1 Getting Started

This section is non-normative.

This specification is designed to ease the prototyping of new types of verifiable credentials. Developers can copy the template below and paste it into common verifiable credential tooling to start issuing, holding, and verifying prototype credentials.

A developer will change MyPrototypeCredential below to the type of credential they would like to create. Since verifiable credentials talk about subjects, each property-value pair in the credentialSubject object expresses a particular property of the credential subject. Once a developer has added a number of these property-value combinations, the modified object can be sent to a conforming issuer implementation, and a verifiable credential will be created for the developer. From a prototyping standpoint, that is all a developer needs to do.

EXAMPLE 1: A template for creating prototype verifiable credentials
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "MyPrototypeCredential"],
  "credentialSubject": {
    "mySubjectProperty": "mySubjectValue"
  }
}

After stabilizing all credential properties, developers are advised to generate and publish vocabulary and context files at stable URLs to facilitate interoperability with other developers. The https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2 URL above would then be replaced with the URL of a use-case-specific context. This process is covered in Section 5.2 Extensibility. Alternatively, developers can reuse existing vocabulary and context files that happen to fit their use case. They can explore the Verifiable Credential Extensions for reusable resources.

4.2 Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable credentials are used to express properties of one or more subjects as well as properties of the credential itself. The following properties are defined in this specification for a verifiable credential:

@context
Defined in Section 4.3 Contexts.
id
Defined in Section 4.4 Identifiers.
type
Defined in Section 4.5 Types.
name
Defined in Section 4.6 Names and Descriptions.
description
Defined in Section 4.6 Names and Descriptions.
issuer
Defined in Section 4.7 Issuer.
credentialSubject
Defined in Section 4.8 Credential Subject.
validFrom
Defined in Section 4.9 Validity Period.
validUntil
Defined in Section 4.9 Validity Period.
status
Defined in Section 4.10 Status.
credentialSchema
Defined in Section 4.11 Data Schemas.
refreshService
Defined in Section 5.4 Refreshing.
termsOfUse
Defined in Section 5.5 Terms of Use.
evidence
Defined in Section 5.6 Evidence.

A verifiable credential can be extended to have additional properties through the extension mechanism defined in Section 5.2 Extensibility.

4.3 Contexts

When two software systems need to exchange data, they need to use terminology that both systems understand. Consider how two people communicate effectively by using the same language, where the words they use, such as "name" and "website," mean the same thing to each individual. This is sometimes referred to as the context of a conversation. This specification uses a similar concept to achieve similar results for software systems by establishing a context in which to communicate.

Software systems that process verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations identify terminology by using URLs for each term. However, those URLs can be long and not very human-friendly, while short-form, human-friendly aliases can be more helpful. This specification uses the @context property to map short-form aliases to the URLs.

Verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations MUST include a @context property. Application developers MUST understand every JSON-LD context used by their application, at least to the extent that it affects the meaning of the terms used by their application. One mechanism for doing so is described in the Section on Validating Contexts in the Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 specification. Other specifications that build upon this specification MAY require that JSON-LD contexts be integrity protected by using the relatedResource feature described in Section 5.3 Integrity of Related Resources or any effectively equivalent mechanism.

@context
The value of the @context property MUST be an ordered set where the first item is a URL with the value https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2. Subsequent items in the ordered set MUST be composed of any combination of URLs and objects, where each is processable as a JSON-LD Context.
EXAMPLE 2: Use of the @context property
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/58473",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleAlumniCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:2g55q912ec3476eba2l9812ecbfe",
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "alumniOf": {
      "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
      "name": "Example University"
    }
  }
}

The example above uses the base context URL (https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2) to establish that the data exchange is about a verifiable credential. This concept is further detailed in Section 5.2 Extensibility. The data available at https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2 is a permanently cacheable static document with instructions for processing it provided in Appendix B.1 Base Context. The associated human-readable vocabulary document for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is available at https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/.

The second URL (https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2) is used to demonstrate examples. Implementations are expected to not use this URL for any other purpose, such as in pilot or production systems.

NOTE: See JSON-LD for more information about @context.

The @context property is further elaborated upon in Section 3.1: The Context of the JSON-LD 1.1 specification.

4.4 Identifiers

When expressing statements about a specific thing, such as a person, product, or organization, using a globally unique identifier for that thing can be useful. Globally unique identifiers enable others to express statements about the same thing. This specification defines the optional id property for such identifiers. The id property allows for expressing statements about specific things in the verifiable credential and is set by an issuer when expressing objects in a verifiable credential or a holder when expressing objects in a verifiable presentation. The id property expresses an identifier that others are expected to use when expressing statements about the specific thing identified by that identifier. Example id values include UUIDs (urn:uuid:0c07c1ce-57cb-41af-bef2-1b932b986873), HTTP URLs (https://id.example/things#123), and DIDs (did:example:1234abcd).

NOTE: Identifiers of any kind increase correlatability

Developers are reminded that identifiers might be harmful when pseudonymity is required. When considering such scenarios, developers are encouraged to read Section 8.4 Identifier-Based Correlation carefully There are also other types of access and correlation mechanisms documented in Section 8. Privacy Considerations that create privacy concerns. Where privacy is a vital consideration, it is permissible to omit the id property. Some use cases do not need or explicitly need to omit, the id property. Similarly, special attention is to be given to the choice between publicly resolvable URLs and other forms of identifiers. Publicly resolvable URLs can facilitate ease of verification and interoperability, yet they might also inadvertently grant access to potentially sensitive information if not used judiciously.

id
The id property is OPTIONAL. If present, id property's value MUST be a single URL, which MAY be dereferenceable. It is RECOMMENDED that the URL in the id be one which, if dereferenceable, results in a document containing machine-readable information about the id.
EXAMPLE 3: Use of the id property
Credential
ecdsa
ecdsa-sd
bbs
jose
cose
sd-jwt
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/3732",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleDegreeCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}

The example above uses two types of identifiers. The first identifier is for the verifiable credential and uses an HTTP-based URL. The second identifier is for the subject of the verifiable credential (the thing the claims are about) and uses a decentralized identifier, also known as a DID.

NOTE: Decentralized Identifiers are optional

DIDs are a type of identifier which are not necessary for verifiable credentials to be useful. Specifically, verifiable credentials do not depend on DIDs and DIDs do not depend on verifiable credentials. However, many verifiable credentials will use DIDs, and software libraries implementing this specification will need to resolve DIDs. DID-based URLs are used to express identifiers associated with subjects, issuers, holders, credential status lists, cryptographic keys, and other machine-readable information associated with a verifiable credential.

4.5 Types

Software systems that process the kinds of objects specified in this document use type information to determine whether or not a provided verifiable credential or verifiable presentation is appropriate for the intended use-case. This specification defines a type property for expressing object type information. This type information can be used during validation processes, as described in Appendix A. Validation.

Verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations MUST contain a type property with an associated value.

type
The value of the type property MUST be one or more terms and absolute URL strings. If more than one value is provided, the order does not matter.
EXAMPLE 4: Use of the type property

  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/3732",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleDegreeCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}

Concerning this specification, the following table lists the objects that MUST have a type specified.

Object	Type
Verifiable credential object	VerifiableCredential and, optionally, a more specific verifiable credential type. For example,
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenBadgeCredential"]
Verifiable presentation object	VerifiablePresentation and, optionally, a more specific verifiable presentation type. For example,
"type": "VerifiablePresentation"
credentialStatus object	A valid credential status type. For example,
"type": "BitstringStatusListEntry"
termsOfUse object	A valid terms of use type. For example,
"type": "TrustFrameworkPolicy"
evidence object	A valid evidence type. For example,
"type": "Evidence"
refreshService object	A valid refreshService type. For example,
"type": "VerifiableCredentialRefreshService2021"
credentialSchema object	A valid credentialSchema type. For example,
"type": "JsonSchema"
NOTE: The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is based on JSON-LD

The type system for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is the same as for JSON-LD 1.1 and is detailed in Section 3.5: Specifying the Type and Section 9: JSON-LD Grammar. When using a JSON-LD context (see Section 5.2 Extensibility), this specification aliases the @type keyword to type to make the JSON-LD documents more easily understood. While application developers and document authors do not need to understand the specifics of the JSON-LD type system, implementers of this specification who want to support interoperable extensibility do.

All credentials, presentations, and encapsulated objects SHOULD specify, or be associated with, additional, more narrow types (like ExampleDegreeCredential, for example) so software systems can more easily detect and process this additional information.

When processing encapsulated objects defined in this specification, such as objects associated with the credentialSubject object or deeply nested therein, software systems SHOULD use the type information specified in encapsulating objects higher in the hierarchy. Specifically, an encapsulating object, such as a credential, SHOULD convey the associated object types so that verifiers can quickly determine the contents of an associated object based on the encapsulating object type.

For example, a credential object with the type of ExampleDegreeCredential, signals to a verifier that the object associated with the credentialSubject property contains the identifier for the:

Subject in the id property.
Type of degree in the type property.
Title of the degree in the name property.

This enables implementers to rely on values associated with the type property for verification. Object types and their associated values are expected to be documented in at least a human-readable specification that can be found at the URL for the type. For example, the human-readable definition for the BitstringStatusList type can be found at https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/status/#BitstringStatusList. It is also suggested that a machine-readable version be provided through HTTP content negotiation at the same URL.

NOTE: See the Implementation Guide for creating new credential types

Explaining how to create a new type of verifiable credential is beyond the scope of this specification. Readers interested in doing so are advised to read the Creating New Credential Types section in the Verifiable Credentials Implementation Guidelines 1.0.

4.6 Names and Descriptions

When displaying a credential, it can be helpful to have text provided by the issuer that furnishes the credential with a name and a short description of its purpose. The name and description properties serve these purposes.

name
An OPTIONAL property that expresses the name of the credential. If present, the value of the name property MUST be a string or a language value object as described in 11.1 Language and Base Direction. Ideally, the name of a credential is concise, human-readable, and could enable an individual to quickly differentiate one credential from any other credentials they might hold.
description
An OPTIONAL property that conveys specific details about a credential. If present, the value of the description property MUST be a string or a language value object as described in 11.1 Language and Base Direction. Ideally, the description of a credential is no more than a few sentences in length and conveys enough information about the credential to remind an individual of its contents without having to look through the entirety of the claims.

      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}

Names and descriptions also support expressing content in different languages. To express a string with language and base direction information, one can use an object that contains the @value, @language, and @direction properties to express the text value, language tag, and base direction, respectively. See 11.1 Language and Base Direction for further information.

NOTE: @direction is not required for single-language strings

The @direction property in the examples below is not required for the associated single-language strings, as their default directions are the same as those set by the @direction value. We include the @direction property here for clarity of demonstration and to make copy+paste+edit deliver functional results. Implementers are encouraged to read the section on String Internationalization in the JSON-LD 1.1 specification.

4.7 Issuer

This specification defines a property for expressing the issuer of a verifiable credential.

A verifiable credential MUST have an issuer property.

issuer
The value of the issuer property MUST be either a URL or an object containing an id property whose value is a URL; in either case, the issuer selects this URL to identify itself in a globally unambiguous way. It is RECOMMENDED that the URL be one which, if dereferenced, results in a controlled identifier document, as defined in the Controlled Identifiers v1.0 specification, about the issuer that can be used to verify the information expressed in the credential.

    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}

It is also possible to express additional information about the issuer by associating an object with the issuer property:

    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}
NOTE: The identifier for an issuer can be any URL

The value of the issuer property can also be a JWK (for example, "https://jwk.example/keys/foo.jwk") or a DID (for example, "did:example:abfe13f712120431c276e12ecab").

4.8 Credential Subject

A verifiable credential contains claims about one or more subjects. This specification defines a credentialSubject property for the expression of claims about one or more subjects.

A verifiable credential MUST contain a credentialSubject property.

credentialSubject
The value of the credentialSubject property is a set of objects where each object MUST be the subject of one or more claims, which MUST be serialized inside the credentialSubject property. Each object MAY also contain an id property to identify the subject, as described in Section 4.4 Identifiers.
EXAMPLE 9: Use of the credentialSubject property

      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}

Expressing information related to multiple subjects in a verifiable credential is possible. The example below specifies two subjects who are spouses. Note the use of array notation to associate multiple subjects with the credentialSubject property.

  }, {
    "id": "https://subject.example/subject/8675",
    "name": "Morgan Doe",
    "spouse": "https://subject.example/subject/7421"
  }]
}
4.9 Validity Period

This specification defines the validFrom property to help an issuer to express the date and time when a credential becomes valid and the validUntil property to express the date and time when a credential ceases to be valid.

When comparing dates and times, the calculation is done "temporally", meaning that the string value is converted to a "temporal value" which exists as a point on a timeline. Temporal comparisons are then performed by checking to see where the date and time being compared are in relation to a particular point on the timeline.

validFrom
If present, the value of the validFrom property MUST be a [XMLSCHEMA11-2] dateTimeStamp string value representing the date and time the credential becomes valid, which could be a date and time in the future or the past. Note that this value represents the earliest point in time at which the information associated with the credentialSubject property becomes valid. If a validUntil value also exists, the validFrom value MUST express a point in time that is temporally the same or earlier than the point in time expressed by the validUntil value.
validUntil
If present, the value of the validUntil property MUST be a [XMLSCHEMA11-2] dateTimeStamp string value representing the date and time the credential ceases to be valid, which could be a date and time in the past or the future. Note that this value represents the latest point in time at which the information associated with the credentialSubject property is valid. If a validFrom value also exists, the validUntil value MUST express a point in time that is temporally the same or later than the point in time expressed by the validFrom value.

      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}
NOTE: Validity start period for Verifiable Credentials

If validFrom and validUntil are not present, the verifiable credential validity period is considered valid indefinitely. In such cases, the verifiable credential is assumed to be valid from the time the verifiable credential was created.

4.10 Status

This specification defines the credentialStatus property for discovering information related to the status of a verifiable credential, such as whether it is suspended or revoked.

If present, the value associated with the credentialStatus property is a single object or a set of one or more objects. The following properties are defined for every object:

id
The id property is OPTIONAL. It MAY be used to provide a unique identifier for the credential status object. If present, the normative guidance in Section 4.4 Identifiers MUST be followed.
type
The type property is REQUIRED. It is used to express the type of status information expressed by the object. The related normative guidance in Section 4.5 Types MUST be followed.

The precise content of the credential status information is determined by the specific credentialStatus type definition and varies depending on factors such as whether it is simple to implement or if it is privacy-enhancing. The value will provide enough information to determine the current status of the credential and whether machine-readable information will be retrievable from the URL. For example, the object could contain a link to an external document that notes whether the credential is suspended or revoked.

EXAMPLE 12: Use of the status property
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/3732",

  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  },
  "credentialStatus": {
    "id": "https://university.example/credentials/status/3#94567",
    "type": "BitstringStatusListEntry",
    "statusPurpose": "revocation",
    "statusListIndex": "94567",
    "statusListCredential": "https://university.example/credentials/status/3"
  }
}

A credential can have more than one status associated with it, such as whether it has been revoked or suspended.

EXAMPLE 13: Use of multiple entries for the status property
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",

    "id": "did:example:f1c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6",
    "license": {
      "type": "ExampleDrivingLicense",
      "name": "License to Drive a Car"
    }
  },
  "credentialStatus": [{
    "id": "https://license.example/credentials/status/84#14278",
    "type": "BitstringStatusListEntry",
    "statusPurpose": "revocation",
    "statusListIndex": "14278",

    "statusPurpose": "suspension",
    "statusListIndex": "82938",
    "statusListCredential": "https://license.example/credentials/status/84"
  }]
}

Implementers are cautioned that credentials with multiple status entries might contain conflicting information. Reconciling such conflicts is a part of the validation process, hence part of the verifier's business logic, and therefore out of scope for this specification.

Defining the data model, formats, and protocols for status schemes is out of the scope of this specification. The Verifiable Credential Extensions document contains available status schemes for implementers who want to implement verifiable credential status checking.

Credential status specifications MUST NOT enable tracking of individuals, such as an issuer being notified (either directly or indirectly) when a verifier is interested in a specific holder or subject. Unacceptable approaches include "phoning home," such that every use of a credential contacts the issuer of the credential to check the status for a specific individual, or "pseudonymity reduction," such that every use of the credential causes a request for information from the issuer that the issuer can use to deduce verifier interest in a specific individual.

4.11 Data Schemas

Data schemas are useful when enforcing a specific structure on a given data collection. There are at least two types of data schemas that this specification considers:

Data verification schemas, which are used to establish that the structure and contents of a credential or verifiable credential conform to a published schema.
Data encoding schemas, which are used to map the contents of a verifiable credential to an alternative representation format, such as a format used in a zero-knowledge proof.

It is important to understand that data schemas serve a different purpose from the @context property, which neither enforces data structure or data syntax nor enables the definition of arbitrary encodings to alternate representation formats.

This specification defines the following property for expressing a data schema, which an issuer can include in the verifiable credentials that it issues:

credentialSchema

The value of the credentialSchema property MUST be one or more data schemas that provide verifiers with enough information to determine whether the provided data conforms to the provided schema(s). Each credentialSchema MUST specify its type (for example, JsonSchema) and an id property that MUST be a URL identifying the schema file. The specific type definition determines the precise contents of each data schema.

If multiple schemas are present, validity is determined according to the processing rules outlined by each associated type property.

NOTE: Credential type-specific syntax checking is possible

The credentialSchema property allows one to annotate type definitions or lock them to specific versions of the vocabulary. Authors of verifiable credentials can include a static version of their vocabulary using credentialSchema that is secured by some content integrity protection mechanism. The credentialSchema property also makes it possible to perform syntactic checking on the credential and to use verification mechanisms such as JSON Schema [VC-JSON-SCHEMA] validation.

EXAMPLE 14: Using the credentialSchema property to perform JSON schema validation
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/3732",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleDegreeCredential", "ExamplePersonCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/14",
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    },
    "alumniOf": {
      "name": "Example University"
    }
  },
  "credentialSchema": [{
    "id": "https://example.org/examples/degree.json",
    "type": "JsonSchema"
  },
  {
    "id": "https://example.org/examples/alumni.json",
    "type": "JsonSchema"
  }]
}

In the example above, the issuer is specifying two credentialSchema objects, each of which point to a JSON Schema [VC-JSON-SCHEMA] file that a verifier can use to determine whether the verifiable credential is well-formed.

4.12 Securing Mechanisms

This specification recognizes two classes of securing mechanisms: those that use enveloping proofs and those that use embedded proofs.

An enveloping proof wraps a serialization of this data model. One such RECOMMENDED enveloping proof mechanism is defined in Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE].

An embedded proof is a mechanism where the proof is included in the serialization of the data model. One such RECOMMENDED embedded proof mechanism is defined in Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY].

These two classes of securing mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Additional securing mechanism specifications might also be defined according to the rules in Section 5.13 Securing Mechanism Specifications.

EXAMPLE 15: A verifiable credential using an embedded proof
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://example.gov/credentials/3732",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleDegreeCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:example:6fb1f712ebe12c27cc26eebfe11",
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "https://subject.example/subject/3921",
    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "DataIntegrityProof",
    "cryptosuite": "eddsa-rdfc-2022",
    "created": "2021-11-13T18:19:39Z",
    "verificationMethod": "https://university.example/issuers/14#key-1",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "proofValue": "z58DAdFfa9SkqZMVPxAQp...jQCrfFPP2oumHKtz"
  }
}

The embedded proof above secures the original credential by decorating the original data with a digital signature via the proof property. This results in a verifiable credential that is easy to manage in modern programming environments and database systems.

The enveloping proof above secures the original credential by encapsulating the original data in a digital signature envelope, resulting in a verifiable credential that can be processed using tooling that understands the SD-JWT format.

4.13 Verifiable Presentations

Verifiable presentations MAY be used to aggregate information from multiple verifiable credentials.

Verifiable presentations SHOULD be extremely short-lived and bound to a challenge provided by a verifier. Details for accomplishing this depend on the securing mechanism, the transport protocol, and verifier policies. Unless additional requirements are defined by the particular securing mechanism or embedding protocol, a verifier cannot generally assume that the verifiable presentation correlates with the presented verifiable credentials.

The default graph of a verifiable presentation is also referred to as the verifiable presentation graph.

The following properties are defined for a verifiable presentation:

id
The id property is optional. It MAY be used to provide a unique identifier for the verifiable presentation. If present, the normative guidance in Section 4.4 Identifiers MUST be followed.
type
The type property MUST be present. It is used to express the type of verifiable presentation. One value of this property MUST be VerifiablePresentation, but additional types MAY be included. The related normative guidance in Section 4.5 Types MUST be followed.
verifiableCredential
The verifiableCredential property MAY be present. The value MUST be one or more verifiable credential and/or enveloped verifiable credential objects (the values MUST NOT be non-object values such as numbers, strings, or URLs). These objects are called verifiable credential graphs and MUST express information that is secured using a securing mechanism. See Section 5.12 Verifiable Credential Graphs for further details.
holder
The verifiable presentation MAY include a holder property. If present, the value MUST be either a URL or an object containing an id property. It is RECOMMENDED that the URL in the holder or its id be one which, if dereferenced, results in a document containing machine-readable information about the holder that can be used to verify the information expressed in the verifiable presentation. If the holder property is absent, information about the holder is obtained either via the securing mechanism or does not pertain to the validation of the verifiable presentation.

The example below shows a verifiable presentation:

EXAMPLE 17: Basic structure of a presentation
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "urn:uuid:3978344f-8596-4c3a-a978-8fcaba3903c5",
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation", "ExamplePresentation"],
  "verifiableCredential": [{ ... }]
}

The contents of the verifiableCredential property shown above are verifiable credential graphs, as described by this specification.

Enveloped Verifiable Credentials

It is possible for a verifiable presentation to include one or more verifiable credentials that have been secured using a securing mechanism that "envelopes" the payload, such as Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE]. This can be accomplished by associating the verifiableCredential property with an object that has a type of EnvelopedVerifiableCredential.

EnvelopedVerifiableCredential
They are used to associate an object containing an enveloped verifiable credential with the verifiableCredential property in a verifiable presentation. The @context property of the object MUST be present and include a context, such as the base context for this specification, that defines at least the id, type, and EnvelopedVerifiableCredential terms as defined by the base context provided by this specification. The id value of the object MUST be a data: URL [RFC2397] that expresses a secured verifiable credential using an enveloping security scheme, such as Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE]. The type value of the object MUST be EnvelopedVerifiableCredential.

The example below shows a verifiable presentation that contains an enveloped verifiable credential:

EXAMPLE 18: Basic structure of a presentation
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation", "ExamplePresentation"],
  "verifiableCredential": [{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "id": "data:application/vc+sd-jwt,QzVjV...RMjU",
    "type": "EnvelopedVerifiableCredential"
  }]
}
NOTE: Processing enveloped content as RDF

It is possible that an implementer might want to process the object described in this section and the enveloped presentation expressed by the id value in an RDF environment and create linkages between the objects that are relevant to RDF. The desire and mechanisms for doing so are use case dependent and will, thus, be implementation dependent.

Enveloped Verifiable Presentations

It is possible to express a verifiable presentation that has been secured using a mechanism that "envelops" the payload, such as Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE]. This can be accomplished by using an object that has a type of EnvelopedVerifiablePresentation.

EnvelopedVerifiablePresentation
Used to express an enveloped verifiable presentation. The @context property of the object MUST be present and include a context, such as the base context for this specification, that defines at least the id, type, and EnvelopedVerifiablePresentation terms as defined by the base context provided by this specification. The id value of the object MUST be a data: URL [RFC2397] that expresses a secured verifiable presentation using an enveloping securing mechanism, such as Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE]. The type value of the object MUST be EnvelopedVerifiablePresentation.

The example below shows an enveloped verifiable presentation:

EXAMPLE 19: Basic structure of an enveloped verifiable presentation
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
  "id": "data:application/vp+jwt,eyJraWQiO...zhwGfQ",
  "type": "EnvelopedVerifiablePresentation"
}
Presentations Using Derived Credentials

Some zero-knowledge cryptography schemes might enable holders to indirectly prove they hold claims from a verifiable credential without revealing all claims in that verifiable credential. In these schemes, a verifiable credential might be used to derive presentable data, which is cryptographically asserted such that a verifier can trust the value if they trust the issuer.

Some selective disclosure schemes can share a subset of claims derived from a verifiable credential.

NOTE: Presentations using Zero-Knowledge Proofs are possible

For an example of a ZKP-style verifiable presentation containing derived data instead of directly embedded verifiable credentials, see Section 5.7 Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

Figure 11 A basic claim expressing that Pat is over the age of 21.
Presentations Including Holder Claims

A holder MAY use the verifiableCredential property in a verifiable presentation to include verifiable credentials from any issuer, including themselves. When the issuer of a verifiable credential is the holder, the claims in that verifiable credential are considered self-asserted. Such self-asserted claims can be secured by the same mechanism that secures the verifiable presentation in which they are included or by any mechanism usable for other verifiable credentials.

The subject(s) of these self-asserted claims are not limited, so these claims can include statements about the holder, one of the other included verifiable credentials or even the verifiable presentation in which the self-asserted verifiable credential is included. In each case, the id property is used to identify the specific subject, in the object where the claims about it are made, just as it is done in verifiable credentials that are not self-asserted.

A verifiable presentation that includes a self-asserted verifiable credential, which is secured only using the same mechanism as the verifiable presentation, MUST include a holder property.

All of the normative requirements defined for verifiable credentials apply to self-asserted verifiable credentials.

A verifiable credential in a verifiable presentation is considered self-asserted when the value of the issuer property of the verifiable credential is identical to the value of the holder property of the verifiable presentation.

The example below shows a verifiable presentation that embeds a self-asserted verifiable credential that is secured using the same mechanism as the verifiable presentation.

EXAMPLE 20: A verifiable presentation, secured with an embedded Data Integrity proof, with a self-asserted verifiable credential
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation", "ExamplePresentation"],
  "holder": "did:example:12345678",
  "verifiableCredential": [{
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
    ],
    "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleFoodPreferenceCredential"],
    "issuer": "did:example:12345678",
    "credentialSubject": {
      "favoriteCheese": "Gouda"
    },
    { ... }
  }],
  "proof": [{ ... }]
}

The example below shows a verifiable presentation that embeds a self-asserted verifiable credential holding claims about the verifiable presentation. It is secured using the same mechanism as the verifiable presentation.

EXAMPLE 21: A verifiable presentation, secured with an embedded Data Integrity proof, with a self-asserted verifiable credential about the verifiable presentation

}
5. Advanced Concepts

Building on the concepts introduced in Section 4. Basic Concepts, this section explores more complex topics about verifiable credentials.

5.1 Trust Model

This section is non-normative.

The verifiable credentials trust model is based on the following expectations:

The verifier expects the issuer to verifiably issue the credential that it receives. This can be established by satisfying either of the following:
An issuer secures a credential with a securing mechanism which establishes that the issuer generated the credential. In other words, an issuer issues a verifiable credential.
A credential is transmitted in a way that clearly establishes that the issuer generated the credential, and that the credential was not tampered with in transit nor storage. This expectation could be weakened, depending on the risk assessment by the verifier.
All entities expect the verifiable data registry to be tamper-evident and to be a correct record of which data is controlled by which entities. This is typically achieved by the method of its publication. This could be via a peer-to-peer protocol from a trusted publisher, a publicly accessible and well known web site (with a content hash), a blockchain, etc. When entities publish metadata about themselves, the publication can be integrity-protected by being secured using with the entity's private key.
The holder and verifier expect the issuer to stand by claims it makes in credentials about the subject, and to revoke credentials quickly if and when they no longer stand by those claims.
The holder might trust the issuer's claims because the holder has a pre-existing trust relationship with the issuer. For example, an employer might provide an employee with an employment verifiable credential, or a government might issue an electronic passport to a citizen.

Where no pre-existing trust relationship exists, the holder might have some out-of-band means of determining whether the issuer is qualified to issue the verifiable credential being provided.

Note: It is not always necessary for the holder to trust the issuer, since the issued verifiable credential might be an assertion about a subject who is not the holder, or about no-one, and the holder might be willing to relay this information to a verifier without being held accountable for its veracity.

The holder expects the credential repository to store credentials securely, to not release credentials to anyone other than the holder (which may subsequently present them to a verifier), and to not corrupt nor lose credentials while they are in its care.

This trust model differentiates itself from other trust models by ensuring the following:

The issuer and verifier do not need to know anything about the credential repository.
The issuer does not need to know anything about the verifier.

How verifiers decide which issuers to trust, and for what data or purposes, is out of scope for this recommendation. Some issuers, such as well-known organizations, might be trusted by many verifiers simply because of their reputation. Some issuers and verifiers might be members of a community in which all members trust each other due to the rules of membership. Some verifiers might trust a specific trust-service provider whose responsibility is to vet issuers and list them in a trust list such as those specified in Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Trusted Lists [ETSI-TRUST-LISTS] or the Adobe Approved Trust List.

By decoupling the expectations between the issuer and the verifier, a more flexible and dynamic trust model is created, such that market competition and customer choice is increased.

For more information about how this trust model interacts with various threat models studied by the Working Group, see the Verifiable Credentials Use Cases [VC-USE-CASES].

NOTE: Trust model differs from the traditional Certificate Authority system

The data model detailed in this specification does not imply a transitive trust model, such as that provided by more traditional Certificate Authority trust models. In the Verifiable Credentials Data Model, a verifier either directly trusts or does not trust an issuer. While it is possible to build transitive trust models using the Verifiable Credentials Data Model, implementers are urged to learn about the security weaknesses introduced by broadly delegating trust in the manner adopted by Certificate Authority systems.

5.2 Extensibility

One of the goals of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model is to enable permissionless innovation. To achieve this, the data model needs to be extensible in a number of different ways. The data model is required to:

Model complex multi-entity relationships through the use of a graph-based data model.
Extend the machine-readable vocabularies used to describe information in the data model, without the use of a centralized system for doing so, through the use of Linked Data [LINKED-DATA].
Support multiple types of cryptographic proof formats through the use of Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE, Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0, and a variety of cryptographic suites listed in the Verifiable Credential Extensions document.
Provide all of the extensibility mechanisms outlined above in a data format that is popular with software developers and web page authors, and is enabled through the use of JSON-LD 1.1.

This approach to data modeling is often called an open world assumption, meaning that any entity can say anything about any other entity. While this approach seems to conflict with building simple and predictable software systems, balancing extensibility with program correctness is always more challenging with an open world assumption than with closed software systems.

The rest of this section describes, through a series of examples, how both extensibility and program correctness are achieved.

Let us assume we start with the credential shown below.

EXAMPLE 22: A simple credential
Credential
ecdsa
ecdsa-sd
bbs
jose
cose
sd-jwt
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://vc.example/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://issuer.example/issuers/14",
  "validFrom": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe"
  }
}

This verifiable credential states that the entity associated with did:example:abcdef1234567 has a name with a value of Jane Doe.

Now let us assume a developer wants to extend the verifiable credential to store two additional pieces of information: an internal corporate reference number, and Jane's favorite food.

The first thing to do is to create a JSON-LD context containing two new terms, as shown below.

EXAMPLE 23: A JSON-LD context
{
  "@context": {
    "referenceNumber": "https://extension.example/vocab#referenceNumber",
    "favoriteFood": "https://extension.example/vocab#favoriteFood"
  }
}

After this JSON-LD context is created, the developer publishes it somewhere so it is accessible to verifiers who will be processing the verifiable credential. Assuming the above JSON-LD context is published at https://extension.example/my-contexts/v1, we can extend this example by including the context and adding the new properties and credential type to the verifiable credential.

EXAMPLE 24: A verifiable credential with a custom extension
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2",
    "https://extension.example/my-contexts/v1"
  ],
  "id": "http://vc.example/credentials/4643",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "CustomExt12"],
  "issuer": "https://issuer.example/issuers/14",
  "validFrom": "2018-02-24T05:28:04Z",
  "referenceNumber": 83294847,
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:abcdef1234567",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "favoriteFood": "Papaya"
  }
}

This example demonstrates extending the Verifiable Credentials Data Model in a permissionless and decentralized way. The mechanism shown also ensures that verifiable credentials created in this way provide a way to prevent namespace conflicts and semantic ambiguity.

A dynamic extensibility model such as this does increase the implementation burden. Software written for such a system has to determine whether verifiable credentials with extensions are acceptable based on the risk profile of the application. Some applications might accept only certain extensions while highly secure environments might not accept any extensions. These decisions are up to the developers of these applications and are specifically not the domain of this specification.

Extension specification authors are urged to ensure that their documents, such as JSON-LD Contexts, are highly available. Developers using these documents might use software that produces errors when these documents cannot be retrieved. Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD contexts are always available include bundling these documents with implementations, content distribution networks with long caching timeframes, or using content-addressed URLs for contexts. These approaches are covered in further detail in Appendix B. Contexts, Vocabularies, Types, and Credential Schemas.

Implementers are advised to pay close attention to the extension points in this specification, such as in Sections 4.10 Status, 4.11 Data Schemas, 4.12 Securing Mechanisms, 5.4 Refreshing, 5.5 Terms of Use, and 5.6 Evidence. While this specification does not define concrete implementations for those extension points, the Verifiable Credential Extensions document provides an unofficial, curated list of extensions that developers can use from these extension points.

Semantic Interoperability

When defining new terms in an application-specific vocabulary, vocabulary authors SHOULD follow the detailed checklist in Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data. Specifically, the following guidance is of particular importance:

Whenever possible, it is RECOMMENDED to re-use terms — and their corresponding URLs — defined by well-known, public vocabularies, such as Schema.org.
New terms MUST define a new URL for each term. When doing so, the general guidelines for [LINKED-DATA] are expected to be followed, in particular:
Human-readable documentation MUST be published, describing the semantics of and the constraints on the use of each term.
It is RECOMMENDED to also publish the collection of all new terms as a machine-readable vocabulary using RDF Schema 1.1.
It SHOULD be possible to dereference the URL of a term, resulting in its description and/or formal definition.

Furthermore, a machine-readable description (that is, a JSON-LD Context document) MUST be published at the URL specified in the @context property for the vocabulary. This context MUST map each term to its corresponding URL, possibly accompanied by further constraints like the type of the property value. A human-readable document describing the expected order of values for the @context property is also expected to be published by any implementer seeking interoperability.

NOTE: Term redefinition is not allowed

When processing the active context defined by the base JSON-LD Context document defined in this specification, compliant JSON-LD-based processors produce an error when a JSON-LD context redefines any term. The only way to change the definition of existing terms is to introduce a new term that clears the active context within the scope of that new term. Authors that are interested in this feature should read about the @protected keyword in the JSON-LD 1.1 specification.

A conforming document SHOULD NOT use the @vocab feature in production as it can lead to JSON term clashes, resulting in semantic ambiguities with other applications. Instead, to achieve proper interoperability, a conforming document SHOULD use JSON-LD Contexts that define all terms used by their applications, as described earlier in Section 5.2 Extensibility. If a conforming document does not use JSON-LD Contexts that define all terms used, it MUST include the https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/undefined-terms/v2 as the last value in the @context property.

5.3 Integrity of Related Resources

When including a link to an external resource in a verifiable credential, it is desirable to know whether the resource has been modified since the verifiable credential was issued. This applies to cases where there is an external resource that is remotely retrieved, as well as to cases where the issuer and/or verifier might have locally cached copies of a resource. It can also be desirable to know that the contents of the JSON-LD context(s) used in the verifiable credential are the same when used by the verifier as they were when used by the issuer.

To extend integrity protection to a related resource, an issuer of a verifiable credential MAY include the relatedResource property:

relatedResource
The value of the relatedResource property MUST be one or more objects of the following form:
Property	Description
id	The identifier for the resource is REQUIRED and conforms to the format defined in Section 4.4 Identifiers. The value MUST be unique among the list of related resource objects.
mediaType	An OPTIONAL valid media type as listed in the IANA Media Types registry.
digestSRI	One or more cryptographic digests, as defined by the hash-expression ABNF grammar defined in the Subresource Integrity specification, Section 3.5: The integrity attribute.
digestMultibase	One or more cryptographic digests, as defined by the digestMultibase property in the Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 specification, Section 2.6: Resource Integrity.
Each object associated with relatedResource MUST contain at least a digestSRI or a digestMultibase value.

If a mediaType is listed, implementations that retrieve the resource identified by the id property using HTTP Semantics SHOULD:

use the media type in the Accept HTTP Header, and
reject the response if it includes a Content-Type HTTP Header with a different media type.

Any object in the verifiable credential that contains an id property MAY be annotated with integrity information by adding either the digestSRI or digestMultibase property, either of which MAY be accompanied by the additionally optional mediaType property.

Any objects for which selective disclosure or unlinkable disclosure is desired SHOULD NOT be included as an object in the relatedResource array.

A conforming verifier implementation that makes use of a resource based on the id of a relatedResource object inside a conforming document with a corresponding cryptographic digest appearing in a relatedResource object value MUST compute the digest of the retrieved resource. If the digest provided by the issuer does not match the digest computed for the retrieved resource, the conforming verifier implementation MUST produce an error.

Implementers are urged to consult appropriate sources, such as the FIPS 180-4 Secure Hash Standard and the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 to ensure that they are choosing a current and reliable hash algorithm. At the time of this writing sha384 SHOULD be considered the minimum strength hash algorithm for use by implementers.

An example of a related resource integrity object referencing JSON-LD contexts.

EXAMPLE 25: Use of the digestSRI property (base64-encoded SHA2-384)
"relatedResource": [{
  "id": "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
  "digestSRI":
    "sha384-Ml/HrjlBCNWyAX91hr6LFV2Y3heB5Tcr6IeE4/Tje8YyzYBM8IhqjHWiWpr8+ZbYU"
},{
  "id": "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2",
  "digestSRI":
    "sha384-MzNNbQTWCSUSi0bbz7dbua+RcENv7C6FvlmYJ1Y+I727HsPOHdzwELMYO9Mz68M26"
}]
EXAMPLE 26: Use of the digestMultibase property (base64-url-nopad-encoded SHA2-256)
"relatedResource": [{
  "id": "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
  "digestMultibase": "uEiBZlVztZpfWHgPyslVv6-UwirFoQoRvW1htfx963sknNA"
},{
  "id": "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2",
  "digestMultibase": "uEiBXOT-8adbvubm13Jy2uYgLCUQ2Cr_i6vRZyeWM8iedfA"
}]
5.4 Refreshing

It is useful for systems to enable the manual or automatic refresh of an expired verifiable credential. For more information about validity periods for verifiable credentials, see Section A.7 Validity Periods. This specification defines a refreshService property, which enables an issuer to include a link to a refresh service.

The issuer can include the refresh service as an element inside the verifiable credential if it is intended for either the verifier or the holder (or both), or inside the verifiable presentation if it is intended for the holder only. In the latter case, this enables the holder to refresh the verifiable credential before creating a verifiable presentation to share with a verifier. In the former case, including the refresh service inside the verifiable credential enables either the holder or the verifier to perform future updates of the credential.

The refresh service is only expected to be used when either the credential has expired or the issuer does not publish credential status information. Issuers are advised not to put the refreshService property in a verifiable credential that does not contain public information or whose refresh service is not protected in some way.

refreshService
The value of the refreshService property MUST be one or more refresh services that provides enough information to the recipient's software such that the recipient can refresh the verifiable credential. Each refreshService value MUST specify its type. The precise content of each refresh service is determined by the specific refreshService type definition.
EXAMPLE 27: Use of the refreshService property by an issuer
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/age/v1"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "AgeVerificationCredential"],
  "issuer": "did:key:z6MksFxi8wnHkNq4zgEskSZF45SuWQ4HndWSAVYRRGe9qDks",
  "validFrom": "2024-04-03T00:00:00.000Z",
  "validUntil": "2024-12-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "name": "Age Verification Credential",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "overAge": 21
  },
  "refreshService": {
    "type": "VerifiableCredentialRefreshService2021",
    "url": "https://registration.provider.example/flows/reissue-age-token",
    "refreshToken": "z2BJYfNtmWRiouWhDrbDQmC2zicUPBxsPg"
  }
}

In the example above, the issuer specifies an automatic refreshService that can be used by POSTing the verifiable credential to the refresh service url. Note that this particular verifiable credential is not intended to be shared with anyone except for the original issuer.

NOTE: Non-authenticated credential refresh

Placing a refreshService property in a verifiable credential so that it is available to verifiers can remove control and consent from the holder and allow the verifiable credential to be issued directly to the verifier, thereby bypassing the holder.

5.5 Terms of Use

Terms of use can be used by an issuer or a holder to communicate the terms under which a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation was issued. The issuer places their terms of use inside the verifiable credential. The holder places their terms of use inside a verifiable presentation. This specification defines a termsOfUse property for expressing terms of use information.

The value of the termsOfUse property might be used to tell the verifier any or all of the following, among other things:

the procedures or policies that were used in issuing the verifiable credential, by providing, for example, a pointer to a public location (to avoid "phone home" privacy issues) where these procedures or policies can be found, or the name of the standard that defines them
the rules and policies of the issuer that apply to the presentation of this verifiable credential to a verifier, by providing, for example, a pointer to a public location (to avoid "phone home" privacy issues) where these rules or policies can be found
the identity of the entity under whose authority the issuer issued this particular verifiable credential
termsOfUse
The value of the termsOfUse property MUST specify one or more terms of use policies under which the creator issued the credential or presentation. If the recipient (a holder or verifier) is not willing to adhere to the specified terms of use, then they do so on their own responsibility and might incur legal liability if they violate the stated terms of use. Each termsOfUse value MUST specify its type, for example, TrustFrameworkPolicy, and MAY specify its instance id. The precise contents of each term of use is determined by the specific termsOfUse type definition.
EXAMPLE 28: Use of the termsOfUse property by an issuer

    }
  }
}

In the example above, the issuer is asserting that the legal basis under which the verifiable credential has been issued is the "professional qualifications directive" using the "Employment&Life" trust framework, with a specific link to the policy.

This feature is expected to be used by government-issued verifiable credentials to instruct digital wallets to limit their use to similar government organizations in an attempt to protect citizens from unexpected use of sensitive data. Similarly, some verifiable credentials issued by private industry are expected to limit use to within departments inside the organization, or during business hours. Implementers are urged to read more about this evolving feature in the appropriate section of the Verifiable Credentials Implementation Guidelines [VC-IMP-GUIDE] document.

5.6 Evidence

Evidence can be included by an issuer to provide the verifier with additional supporting information in a verifiable credential. This could be used by the verifier to establish the confidence with which it relies on the claims in the verifiable credential. For example, an issuer could check physical documentation provided by the subject or perform a set of background checks before issuing the credential. In certain scenarios, this information is useful to the verifier when determining the risk associated with relying on a given credential.

This specification defines the evidence property for expressing evidence information.

evidence
If present, the value of the evidence property MUST be either a single object or a set of one or more objects. The following properties are defined for every evidence object:
id
The id property is OPTIONAL. It MAY be used to provide a unique identifier for the evidence object. If present, the normative guidance in Section 4.4 Identifiers MUST be followed.
type
The type property is REQUIRED. It is used to express the type of evidence information expressed by the object. The related normative guidance in Section 4.5 Types MUST be followed.
NOTE: See Implementation Guide for strategies for providing evidence

For information about how attachments and references to credentials and non-credential data might be supported by the specification, see Section 5.3 Integrity of Related Resources.

    }
  ]
}

In the evidence example above, the issuer is asserting that they have video of the subject of the credential demonstrating the achievement.

NOTE: Evidence has a different purpose from securing mechanisms

The evidence property provides information that is different from and information to the securing mechanism used. The evidence property is used to express supporting information, such as documentary evidence, related to the verifiable credential. In contrast, the securing mechanism is used to express machine-verifiable mathematical proofs related to the authenticity of the issuer and integrity of the verifiable credential. For more information about securing mechanisms, see Section 4.12 Securing Mechanisms.

5.7 Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs are securing mechanisms which enable a holder to prove that they hold a verifiable credential containing a value without disclosing the actual value such as being able to prove that an individual is over the age of 25 without revealing their birthday. This data model supports being secured using zero-knowledge proofs.

Some capabilities that are compatible with verifiable credentials which are made possible by zero-knowledge proof mechanisms include:

Selective disclosure of the properties in a verifiable credential by the holder to a verifier. This allows a holder to provide a verifier with precisely the information they need and nothing more. This also enables the production of a derived verifiable credential that is formatted according to the verifier's data schema without needing to involve the issuer during presentation. This provides a great deal of flexibility for holders to use their issued verifiable credentials.
Unlinkable disclosure of the properties in a verifiable credential by the holder to a verifier. Blinded signatures allow for unlinkable disclosure, which remove a common source of holder correlation during multiple presentations to one or more verifiers. This allows a holder to share a different signature value with each presentation, which in turn reduces the amount of data shared.
Non-correlatable identification of the holder and/or subject. This allows a holder to prove that a credential was issued to them, or a subject to prove that a credential was issued about them, without sharing a correlatable identifier. This also reduces the amount of data necessary to be shared. This capability can also be used to combine multiple verifiable credentials from multiple issuers into a single verifiable presentation without revealing verifiable credential or subject identifiers to the verifier.

Specification authors that create securing mechanisms MUST NOT design them in such a way that they leak information that would enable the verifier to correlate a holder across multiple verifiable presentations to different verifiers.

Not all capabilities are supported in all zero-knowledge proof mechanisms. Specific details about the capabilities and techniques provided by a particular zero knowledge proof mechanism, along with any normative requirements for using them with verifiable credentials, would be found in a specification for securing verifiable credentials with that zero-knowledge proof mechanism. For an example of such a specification, refer to the Data Integrity BBS Cryptosuites v1.0.

We note that in most instances, for the holder to make use of zero knowledge mechanisms with verifiable credentials, the issuer is required to secure the verifiable credential in a manner that supports these capabilities.

The diagram below highlights how the data model might be used to issue and present verifiable credentials in zero-knowledge.

Figure 12 A visual example of the relationship between credentials and derived credentials in a ZKP presentation.

An example of a verifiable credential and a verifiable presentation using the Data Integrity BBS Cryptosuites v1.0 unlinkable selective disclosure securing mechanism is shown below.

The example above is a verifiable credential where the issuer has enabled a BBS-based unlinkable disclosure scheme to create a base proof that can then be used by the holder to create a derived proof that reveals only particular pieces of information from the original verifiable credential.

The verifiable presentation above includes a verifiable credential that contains an unlinkable subset of the information from the previous example and a derived proof that the verifier can use to verify that the information originated from the expected issuer and is bound to this particular exchange of information.

5.8 Representing Time

Implementers are urged to understand that representing and processing time values is not as straight-forward as it might seem and have a variety of idiosyncrasies that are not immediately obvious nor uniformly observed in different regions of the world. For example:

Calendaring systems other than the Gregorian calendar are actively used by various regions.
When processing Daylight Saving/Summer Time, it is important to understand that 1) it is not observed in all regions, 2) it does not necessarily begin or end on the same day or at the same time of day, and 3) the amount or direction of the adjustment does not always match other similar regions.
Leap seconds might not be taken into account in all software systems, especially for dates and times that precede the introduction of the leap second. Leap seconds can affect highly sensitive systems that depend on the exact millisecond offset from the epoch. However, note that for most applications the only moment in time that is affected is the one second period of the leap second itself. That is, the moment after the most recent leap second can always be represented as the first moment of the next day (for example, 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z), regardless of whether the system in question understands leap seconds.

These are just a few examples that illustrate that the actual time of day, as would be seen on a clock on the wall, can exist in one region but not exist in another region. For this reason, implementers are urged to use time values that are more universal, such as values anchored to the Z time zone over values that are affected by Daylight Saving/Summer Time.

This specification attempts to increase the number of universally recognized combinations of dates and times, and reduce the potential for misinterpretation of time values, by using the dateTimeStamp construction first established by the [XMLSCHEMA11-2] specification. In order to reduce misinterpretations between different time zones, all time values expressed in conforming documents SHOULD be specified in dateTimeStamp format, either in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), denoted by a Z at the end of the value, or with a time zone offset relative to UTC. Time values that are incorrectly serialized without an offset MUST be interpreted as UTC. Examples of valid time zone offsets relative to UTC include Z, +01:00, -08:00, and +14:00. See the regular expression at the end of this section for a formal definition of all acceptable values.

Time zone definitions are occasionally changed by their governing body. When replacing or issuing new verifiable credentials, implementers are advised to ensure that changes to local time zone rules do not result in unexpected gaps in validity. For example, consider the zone America/Los_Angeles, which has a raw offset of UTC-8 and had voted to stop observing daylight savings time in the year 2024. A given verifiable credential that had a validUtil value of 2024-07-12T12:00:00-07:00, might be re-issued to have a validFrom value of 2024-07-12T12:00:00-08:00, which would create a gap of an hour where the verifiable credential would not be valid.

Implementers that desire to check dateTimeStamp values for validity can use the regular expression provided below, which is reproduced from the [XMLSCHEMA11-2] specification for convenience. To avoid doubt, the regular expression in [XMLSCHEMA11-2] is the normative definition. Implementers are advised that not all dateTimeStamp values that pass the regular expression below are valid moments in time. For example, the regular expression below allows for 31 days in every month, which allows for leap years, and leap seconds, as well as days in places where they do not exist. That said, modern system libraries that generate dateTimeStamp values are often error-free in their generation of valid dateTimeStamp values. The regular expression shown below (minus the whitespace included here for readability), is often adequate when processing library-generated dates and times on modern systems.

EXAMPLE 32: Regular expression to detect a valid XML Schema 1.1: Part 2 dateTimeStamp
-?([1-9][0-9]{3,}|0[0-9]{3})
-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])
-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])
T(([01][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9](\.[0-9]+)?|(24:00:00(\.0+)?))
(Z|(\+|-)((0[0-9]|1[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]|14:00))
5.9 Authorization

This section is non-normative.

Verifiable credentials are intended as a means of reliably identifying subjects. While it is recognized that Role Based Access Controls (RBACs) and Attribute Based Access Controls (ABACs) rely on this identification as a means of authorizing subjects to access resources, this specification does not provide a complete solution for RBAC or ABAC. Authorization is not an appropriate use for this specification without an accompanying authorization framework.

The Working Group did consider authorization use cases during the creation of this specification and is pursuing that work as an architectural layer built on top of this specification.

5.10 Reserved Extension Points

This specification reserves a number of properties to serve as possible extension points. While some implementers signaled interest in these properties, their inclusion in this specification was considered to be premature. It is important to note that none of these properties are defined by this specification. Consequently, implementers are cautioned that use of these properties is considered experimental.

Implementers MAY use these properties, but SHOULD expect them and/or their meanings to change during the process of normatively specifying them. Implementers SHOULD NOT use these properties without a publicly disclosed specification describing their implementation.

In order to avoid collisions regarding how the following properties are used, implementations MUST specify a type property in the value associated with the reserved property. For more information related to adding type information, see Section 4.5 Types.

Reserved Property	Description
confidenceMethod	A property used for specifying one or more methods that a verifier might use to increase their confidence that the value of a property in or of a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation is accurate. The associated vocabulary URL MUST be https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials#confidenceMethod.
renderMethod	A property used for specifying one or more methods to render a credential into a visual, auditory, haptic, or other format. The associated vocabulary URL MUST be https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials#renderMethod.

An unofficial list of specifications that are associated with the extension points defined in this specification, as well as the reserved extension points defined in this section, can be found in the Verifiable Credential Extensions. Items in the directory that refer to reserved extension points SHOULD be treated as experimental.

5.11 Ecosystem Compatibility

There are a number of digital credential formats that do not natively use the data model provided in this document, but are aligned with a number of concepts in this specification. At the time of publication, examples of these digital credential formats include JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs), JSON Advanced Electronic Signature (JAdES), ISO-18013-5:2021 (mDLs), AnonCreds, Gordian Envelopes, and Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs).

If conceptually aligned digital credential formats can be transformed into a conforming document according to the rules provided in this section, they are considered "compatible with the W3C Verifiable Credentials ecosystem". Specification authors are advised to adhere to the following rules when documenting transformations that enable compatibility with the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem. The transformation specification —

MUST identify whether the transformation to this data model is one-way-only or round-trippable.
MUST preserve the @context values when performing round-trippable transformation.
MUST result in a conforming document when transforming to the data model described by this specification.
MUST specify a registered media type for the input document.
SHOULD provide a test suite that demonstrates that the specified transformation algorithm to the data model in this specification results in a conforming document.
SHOULD ensure that all semantics used in the transformed conforming document follow best practices for Linked Data. See Section 4.1 Getting Started, Section 5.2 Extensibility, and Linked Data Best Practices [LD-BP] for additional guidance.
NOTE: What constitutes a verifiable credential?

Readers are advised that a digital credential is only considered compatible with the W3C Verifiable Credentials ecosystem if it is a conforming document and it uses at least one securing mechanism, as described by their respective requirements in this specification. While some communities might call some digital credential formats that are not conforming documents "verifiable credentials", doing so does NOT make that digital credential compliant to this specification.

5.12 Verifiable Credential Graphs

When expressing verifiable credentials (for example in a presentation), it is important to ensure that data in one verifiable credential is not mistaken to be the same data in another verifiable credential. For example, if one has two verifiable credentials, each containing an object of the following form: {"type": "Person", "name": "Jane Doe"}, it is not possible to tell if one object is describing the same person as the other object. In other words, merging data between two verifiable credentials without confirming that they are discussing the same entities and/or properties, can lead to a corrupted data set.

To ensure that data from different verifiable credentials are not accidentally co-mingled, the concept of a verifiable credential graph is used to encapsulate each verifiable credential. For simple verifiable credentials, that is, when the JSON-LD document contains a single credential with, possibly, associated proofs, this graph is the default graph. For presentations, each value associated with the verifiableCredential property of the presentation is a separate named graph of type VerifiableCredentialGraph which contains a single verifiable credential or an enveloped verifiable credential.

Using these graphs has a concrete effect when performing JSON-LD processing, which properly separates graph node identifiers in one graph from those in another graph. Implementers that limit their inputs to application-specific JSON-LD documents will also need to keep this in mind if they merge data from one verifiable credential with data from another, such as when the credentialSubject.id is the same in both verifiable credentials, but the object might contain objects of the "Jane Doe" form described in the previous paragraph. It is important to not merge objects that seem to have similar properties but do not contain an id property that uses a global identifier, such as a URL.

5.13 Securing Mechanism Specifications

As described in Section 4.12 Securing Mechanisms, there are multiple strategies that an implementer can use when securing a conforming document. In order to maximize utility and interoperability, specification authors that desire to author new ways of securing conforming documents are provided with the guidance in this section.

Securing mechanism specifications MUST document normative algorithms that provide content integrity protection for conforming documents. The algorithms MAY be general in nature and MAY be used to secure data other than conforming documents.

Securing mechanism specifications MUST provide a verification algorithm that returns the information in the conforming document that has been secured, in isolation, without including any securing mechanism information, such as proof or JOSE/COSE header parameters and signatures. Verification algorithms MAY return additional information that might be helpful (for example, during validation or for debugging purposes), such as details of the securing mechanism. A verification algorithm MUST provide an interface that receives a media type (string inputMediaType) and input data (byte sequence or map inputData). Securing mechanism specifications MAY provide algorithms and interfaces in addition to the ones specified in this document. The verification algorithm returns a verification result with at least the following items:

boolean verified
A verification status whose value is true if the verification succeeded and false if it did not.
map verifiedDocument
A document that only contains information that was successfully secured.
string mediaType
A media type as defined in [RFC6838].

Securing mechanism specifications SHOULD provide integrity protection for any information referenced by a URL that is critical to validation. Mechanisms that can achieve this protection are discussed in Section 5.3 Integrity of Related Resources and Section B.1 Base Context.

A securing mechanism specification that creates a new type of embedded proof MUST specify a property that relates the verifiable credential or verifiable presentation to a proof graph. The requirements on the securing mechanism are as follow:

The securing mechanism MUST define all terms used by the proof graph. For example, the mechanism could define vocabulary specifications and @context files in the same manner as they are used by this specification.
The securing mechanism MUST secure all graphs in the verifiable credential or the verifiable presentation, except for any proof graphs securing the verifiable credential or the verifiable presentation itself.
NOTE

The last requirement means that the securing mechanism secures the default graph and, for verifiable presentations, each verifiable credential of the presentation, together with their respective proof graphs. See also Figure 9 or Figure 14.

The proof property as defined in [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY] MAY be used by the embedded securing mechanism.

Securing mechanism specifications SHOULD register the securing mechanism in the Securing Mechanisms section of the Verifiable Credential Extensions document.

NOTE: Choice of securing mechanism is use-case dependent

There are multiple acceptable securing mechanisms, and this specification does not mandate any particular securing mechanism for use with verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations. The Working Group that produced this specification did standardize two securing mechanism options, which are: Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY] and Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE]. Other securing mechanisms that are known to the community can be found in the Securing Mechanisms section of the Verifiable Credential Extensions document.

6. Syntaxes

The data model as described in Sections 3. Core Data Model, 4. Basic Concepts, and 5. Advanced Concepts is the canonical structural representation of a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation. All syntaxes are representations of that data model in a specific format. This section specifies how the data model is serialized in JSON-LD for application/vc and application/vp, the base media types for verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, respectively. Although syntactic mappings are only provided for JSON-LD, applications and services can use any other data representation syntax (such as XML, YAML, or CBOR) that is capable of being mapped back to application/vc or application/vp. As the verification and validation requirements are defined in terms of the data model, all serialization syntaxes have to be deterministically translated to the data model for processing, validation, or comparison.

The expected arity of the property values in this specification, and the resulting datatype which holds those values, can vary depending on the property. If present, the following properties are represented as a single value: id (Section 4.4 Identifiers), issuer (Section 4.7 Issuer), and validFrom/validUntil (Section 4.9 Validity Period). All other properties, if present, are represented as either a single value or an array of values.

6.1 JSON-LD

This specification uses JSON-LD 1.1 to serialize the data model described in this specification. JSON-LD is useful because it enables the expression of the graph-based data model on which verifiable credentials are based, machine-readable semantics, and is also useful when extending the data model (see Sections 3. Core Data Model and 5.2 Extensibility).

JSON-LD is a JSON-based format used to serialize Linked Data. Linked Data is modeled using Resource Description Framework (RDF) [RDF11-CONCEPTS]. RDF is a technology for modeling graphs of statements. Each statement is a single subject→property→value (also known as entity→attribute→value) relationship, which is referred to as a claim in this specification. JSON-LD is a technology that enables the expression of RDF using idiomatic JSON, enabling developers familiar with JSON to write applications that consume RDF as JSON. See Relationship of JSON-LD to RDF for more details.

Notable JSON-LD Features

In general, the data model and syntax described in this document enables developers to largely treat verifiable credentials as JSON documents, allowing them to copy and paste examples, with minor modification, into their software systems. The design goal of this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry while still ensuring global interoperability between a heterogeneous set of software systems. This section describes some of the JSON-LD features that are used to make this possible, which will likely go unnoticed by most developers, but whose details might be of interest to implementers. The most noteworthy features in JSON-LD 1.1 used by this specification include:

The @id and @type keywords are aliased to id and type respectively, enabling developers to use this specification as idiomatic JSON.
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that require them.
The verifiableCredential property is defined as a JSON-LD 1.1 graph container. This requires the creation of named graphs, used to isolate sets of data asserted by different entities. This ensures, for example, proper cryptographic separation between the data graph provided by each issuer and the one provided by the holder presenting the verifiable credential to ensure the provenance of the information for each graph is preserved.
The @protected properties feature of JSON-LD 1.1 is used to ensure that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means that as long as the same @context declaration is made at the top of a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation, interoperability is guaranteed for all terms understood by users of the data model whether or not they use a JSON-LD 1.1 processor.
Restrictions on JSON-LD

In order to increase interoperability, this specification restricts the use of JSON-LD representations of the data model. JSON-LD compacted document form MUST be used for all representations of the data model using the application/vc or application/vp media type.

As elaborated upon in Section 6.3 Type-Specific Credential Processing, some software applications might not perform generalized JSON-LD processing. Authors of conforming documents are advised that interoperability might be reduced if JSON-LD keywords in the @context value are used to globally affect values in a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation, such as by setting either or both of the @base or @vocab keywords. For example, setting these values might trigger a failure in a mis-implemented JSON Schema test of the @context value in an implementation that is performing type-specific credential processing and not expecting the @base and/or @vocab value to be expressed in the @context value.

In order to increase interoperability, conforming document authors are urged to not use JSON-LD features that are not easily detected when performing type-specific credential processing. These features include:

In-line declaration of JSON-LD keywords in the @context value that globally modify document term and value processing, such as setting @base or @vocab
Use of JSON-LD contexts that override declarations in previous contexts, such as resetting @vocab
In-line declaration of JSON-LD contexts in the @context property
Use of full URLs for JSON-LD terms and types (for example, https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials#VerifiableCredential or https://vocab.example/myvocab#SomeNewType) instead of the short forms of any such values (for example, VerifiableCredential or SomeNewType) that are explicitly defined in JSON-LD @context mappings (for example, in https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2)

While this specification cautions against the use of @vocab, there are legitimate uses of the feature, such as to ease experimentation, development, and localized deployment. If an application developer wants to use @vocab in production, which is advised against to reduce term collisions and leverage the benefits of semantic interoperability, they are urged to understand that any use of @vocab will disable reporting of "undefined term" errors, and later use(s) will override any previous @vocab declaration(s). Different values of @vocab can change the semantics of the information contained in the document, so it is important to understand whether and how these changes will affect the application being developed.

Lists and Arrays

Lists, arrays, and even lists of lists, are possible when using JSON-LD 1.1. We encourage those who want RDF semantics in use cases requiring lists and arrays to follow the guidance on lists in JSON-LD 1.1.

In general, a JSON array is ordered, while a JSON-LD array is not ordered unless that array uses the @list keyword.

NOTE: Array order might not matter

While it is possible to use this data model by performing type-specific credential processing, those who do so and make use of arrays need to be aware that unless the above guidance is followed, the order of items in an array are not guaranteed in JSON-LD. This might lead to unexpected behavior.

If JSON structure or ordering is important to your application, we recommend you mark such elements as @json via an @context that is specific to your use case. An example of such a declaration is shown below.

EXAMPLE 33: A @context file that defines a matrix as an embedded JSON data structure
{
  "@context":
    {
      "matrix": {
        "@id": "https://website.example/vocabulary#matrix",
        "@type": "@json"
      }
    }
}

When the context shown above is used in the example below, by including the https://website.example/matrix/v1 context in the @context property, the value in credentialSubject.matrix retains its JSON semantics; the exact order of all elements in the two dimensional matrix is preserved.

EXAMPLE 34: A verifiable credential with an embedded JSON data structure
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2",
    "https://website.example/matrix/v1"
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/1872",
  "type": [
    "VerifiableCredential",
    "ExampleMatrixCredential"
  ],
  "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/565049",
  "validFrom": "2010-01-01T19:23:24Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
    "matrix": [
      [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],
      [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],
      [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
    ]
  }
}
6.2 Media Types

Media types, as defined in [RFC6838], identify the syntax used to express a verifiable credential as well as other useful processing guidelines.

Syntaxes used to express the data model in this specification SHOULD be identified by a media type, and conventions outlined in this section SHOULD be followed when defining or using media types with verifiable credentials.

There are two media types associated with the core data model, which are listed in the Section C. IANA Considerations: application/vc and application/vp.

The application/vc and application/vp media types do not imply any particular securing mechanism, but are intended to be used in conjunction with securing mechanisms. A securing mechanism needs to be applied to protect the integrity of these media types. Do not assume security of content regardless of the media type used to communicate it.

Media Type Precision

This section is non-normative.

At times, developers or systems might use lower precision media types to convey verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations. Some of the reasons for use of lower precision media types include:

A web server defaults to text/plain or application/octet-stream when a file extension is not available and it cannot determine the media type.
A developer adds a file extension that leads to a media type that is less specific than the content of the file. For example, .json could result in a media type of application/json and .jsonld might result in a media type of application/ld+json.
A protocol requires a less precise media type for a particular transaction; for example, application/json instead of application/vp,

Implementers are urged to not raise errors when it is possible to determine the intended media type from a payload, provided that the media type used is acceptable in the given protocol. For example, if an application only accepts payloads that conform to the rules associated with the application/vc media type, but the payload is tagged with application/json or application/ld+json instead, the application might perform the following steps to determine whether the payload also conforms to the higher precision media type:

Parse the payload as a JSON document.
Ensure that the first element of the @context property matches https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2.
Assume an application/vp media type if the JSON document contains a top-level type property containing a VerifiablePresentation element. Additional subsequent checks are still expected to be performed (according to this specification) to ensure the payload expresses a conformant verifiable presentation.
Assume an application/vc media type if the JSON document contains a top-level type property containing a VerifiableCredential element. Additional subsequent checks are still expected to be performed (according to this specification) to ensure the payload expresses a conformant verifiable credential.

Whenever possible, implementers are advised to use the most precise (the highest precision) media type for all payloads defined by this specification. Implementers are also advised to recognize that a payload tagged with a lower precision media type does not mean that the payload does not meet the rules necessary to tag it with a higher precision type. Similarly, a payload tagged with a higher precision media type does not mean that the payload will meet the requirements associated with the media type. Receivers of payloads, regardless of their associated media type, are expected to perform appropriate checks to ensure that payloads conform with the requirements for their use in a given system.

HTTP clients and servers use media types associated with verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations in accept headers and when indicating content types. Implementers are warned that HTTP servers might ignore the accept header and return another content type, or return an error code such as 415 Unsupported Media Type.

6.3 Type-Specific Credential Processing

This section is non-normative.

As JSON can be used to express different kinds of information, a consumer of a particular JSON document can only properly interpret the author's intent if they possess information that contextualizes and disambiguates it from other possible expressions. Information to assist with this interpretation can either be wholly external to the JSON document or linked from within it. Compacted JSON-LD documents include a @context property that internally expresses or links to contextual information to express claims. These features enable generalized processors to be written to convert JSON-LD documents from one context to another, but this is not needed when consumers receive JSON-LD documents that already use the context and shape that they expect. Authors of JSON-LD documents, such as issuers of verifiable credentials, are required to provide proper JSON-LD contexts and follow these rules in order to facilitate interoperability.

The text below helps consumers understand how to ensure a JSON-LD document is expressed in a context and shape that their application already understands such that they do not need to transform it in order to consume its contents. Notably, this does not mean that consumers do not need to understand any context at all; rather, consuming applications only need to understand a chosen set of contexts and document shapes to work with and not others. Issuers can publish contexts and information about their verifiable credentials to aid consumers who do not use generalized processors, just as can be done with any other JSON-formatted data.

General JSON-LD processing is defined as a mechanism that uses a JSON-LD software library to process a conforming document by performing various transformations. Type-specific credential processing is defined as a lighter-weight mechanism for processing conforming documents, that doesn't require a JSON-LD software library. Some consumers of verifiable credentials only need to consume credentials with specific types. These consumers can use type-specific credential processing instead of generalized processing. Scenarios where type-specific credential processing can be desirable include, but are not limited to, the following:

Before applying a securing mechanism to a conforming document, or after verifying a conforming document protected by a securing mechanism, to ensure data integrity.
When performing JSON Schema validation, as described in Section 4.11 Data Schemas.
When serializing or deserializing verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations into systems that store or index their contents.
When operating on verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations in a software application, after verification or validation is performed for securing mechanisms that require general JSON-LD processing.
When an application chooses to process the media type using the +json structured media type suffix.

That is, type-specific credential processing is allowed as long as the document being consumed or produced is a conforming document.

If type-specific credential processing is desired, an implementer is advised to follow this rule:

Ensure that all values associated with a @context property are in the expected order, the contents of the context files match known good cryptographic hashes for each file, and domain experts have deemed that the contents are appropriate for the intended use case.

Using static context files with a JSON Schema is one acceptable approach to implementing the rule above. This can ensure proper term identification, typing, and order, when performing type-specific credential processing.

The rule above guarantees semantic interoperability between the two processing mechanisms for mapping literal JSON keys to URIs via the @context mechanism. While general JSON-LD processing can use previously unseen @context values provided in its algorithms to verify that all terms are correctly specified, implementations that perform type-specific credential processing only accept specific @context values which the implementation is engineered ahead of time to understand, resulting in the same semantics without invoking any JSON-LD APIs. In other words, the context in which the data exchange happens is explicitly stated for both processing mechanisms by using @context in a way that leads to the same conforming document semantics.

7. Algorithms

This section contains algorithms that can be used by implementations to perform common operations, such as verification. Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms use normative concepts from the Infra Standard [INFRA]. See the section on Algorithm Conformance in the Infra Standard for more guidance on implementation requirements.

NOTE: Implementers can include additional checks, warnings, and errors.

Implementers are advised that the algorithms in this section contain the bare minimum set of checks used by implementations to test conformance to this specification. Implementations are expected to provide additional checks that report helpful warnings for developers to help debug potential issues. Similarly, implementations are likely to provide additional checks that could result in new types of errors being reported in order to stop harmful content. Any of these additional checks might be integrated into future versions of this specification.

7.1 Verification

This section contains an algorithm that conforming verifier implementations MUST run when verifying a verifiable credential or a verifiable presentation. This algorithm takes a media type (string inputMediaType) and secured data (byte sequence inputData) and returns a map that contains the following:

a status (boolean status)
a conforming document (map document)
a media type (string mediaType)
a controller of the verification method associated with the securing mechanism (string controller)
a controlled identifier document that is associated with the verification method used to verify the securing mechanism (map controlledIdentifierDocument)
zero or more warnings (list of ProblemDetails warnings)
zero or more errors (list of ProblemDetails errors)

The verification algorithm is as follows:

Ensure that the securing mechanism has properly protected the conforming document by performing the following steps:
Set the verifyProof function by using the inputMediaType and the Securing Mechanisms section of the Verifiable Credential Extensions document, or other mechanisms known to the implementation, to determine the cryptographic suite to use when verifying the securing mechanism. The verifyProof function MUST implement the interface described in 5.13 Securing Mechanism Specifications.
If the verifyProof function expects a byte sequence, provide inputMediaType and inputData to the algorithm. If the verifyProof function expects a map, provide inputMediaType and the result of parse JSON bytes to an Infra value given inputData. Set result to the result of the call to the verifyProof function. If the call was successful, result will contain the status, document, mediaType, controller, controlledIdentifierDocument, warnings, and errors properties.
If result.status is set to false, add a CRYPTOGRAPHIC_SECURITY_ERROR to result.errors.
If result.status is set to true, ensure that result.document is a conforming document. If it is not, set result.status to false, remove the document property from result, and add at least one MALFORMED_VALUE_ERROR to result.errors. Other warnings and errors MAY be included to aid any debugging process.
Return result.

The steps for verifying the state of the securing mechanism and verifying that the input document is a conforming document MAY be performed in a different order than that provided above as long as the implementation returns errors for the same invalid inputs. Implementations MAY produce different errors than described above.

7.2 Problem Details

When an implementation detects an anomaly while processing a document, a ProblemDetails object can be used to report the issue to other software systems. The interface for these objects follow [RFC9457] to encode the data. A ProblemDetails object consists of the following properties:

type
The type property MUST be present and its value MUST be a URL identifying the type of problem.
title
The title property SHOULD provide a short but specific human-readable string for the problem.
detail
The detail property SHOULD provide a longer human-readable string for the problem.

The following problem description types are defined by this specification:

https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model#PARSING_ERROR
There was an error while parsing input.
https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model#CRYPTOGRAPHIC_SECURITY_ERROR
The securing mechanism for the document has detected a modification in the contents of the document since it was created; potential tampering detected. See Section 7.1 Verification.
https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model#MALFORMED_VALUE_ERROR
The value associated with a particular property is malformed. The name of the property and the path to the property SHOULD be provided in the ProblemDetails object. See Section 7.1 Verification.
https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model#RANGE_ERROR
A provided value is outside of the expected range of an associated value, such as a given index value for an array being larger than the current size of the array.

Implementations MAY extend the ProblemDetails object by specifying additional types or properties. See the Extension Member section in [RFC9457] for further guidance on using this mechanism.

8. Privacy Considerations

This section is non-normative.

This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy implications of deploying the Verifiable Credentials Data Model into production environments.

8.1 Spectrum of Privacy

This section is non-normative.

It is important to recognize there is a spectrum of privacy ranging from pseudonymous to strongly identified. Depending on the use case, people have different comfort levels about the information they are willing to provide and the information that can be derived from it.

Figure 13 Privacy spectrum ranging from pseudonymous to fully identified.

Privacy solutions are use case specific. For example, many people would prefer to remain anonymous when purchasing alcohol because the regulation is only to verify whether a purchaser is above a specific age. In contrast, when filling prescriptions written by a medical professional for a patient, the pharmacy is legally required to more strongly identify both the prescriber and the patient. No single approach to privacy works for all use cases.

NOTE: Proof of age might be insufficient for some use cases

Even those who want to remain anonymous when purchasing alcohol might need to provide photo identification to appropriately assure the merchant. The merchant might not need to know your name or any details other than that you are over a specific age, but in many cases, simple proof of age might be insufficient to meet regulations.

The Verifiable Credentials Data Model strives to support the full privacy spectrum and does not take philosophical positions on the correct level of anonymity for any specific transaction. The following sections will guide implementers who want to avoid specific scenarios that are hostile to privacy.

8.2 Software Trust Boundaries

This section is non-normative.

A variety of trust relationships exist in the ecosystem described by this specification. An individual using a web browser trusts the web browser, also known as a user agent, to preserve that trust by not uploading their personal information to a data broker; similarly, entities filling the roles in the ecosystem described by this specification trust the software that operates on behalf of each of those roles. Examples include the following:

An issuer's user agent (issuer software), such as an online education platform, is expected to issue verifiable credentials only to individuals that the issuer asserts have completed their educational program.
A verifier's user agent (verification software), such as a hiring website, is expected to only allow access to individuals with a valid verification status for verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations provided to the platform by such individuals.
A holder's user agent (holder software), such as a digital wallet, is expected to only divulge information to a verifier when the holder consents to releasing that information.

The examples above are not exhaustive, and the users in these roles can also expect various other things from the software they use to achieve their goals. In short, the user expects the software to operate in the user's best interests; any violations of this expectation breach trust and can lead to the software's replacement with a more trustworthy alternative. Implementers are strongly encouraged to create software that preserves user trust. Additionally, they are encouraged to include auditing features that enable users or trusted third parties to verify that the software is operating in alignment with their best interests.

Readers are advised that some software, like a website providing services to a single verifier and multiple holders, might operate as a user agent to both roles but might not always be able to operate simultaneously in the best interests of all parties. For example, suppose a website detects an attempt at fraudulent verifiable credential use among multiple holders. In that case, it might report such an anomaly to the verifier, which might be considered not to be in all holders' best interest, but would be in the best interest of the verifier and any holders not committing such a violation. It is imperative that when software operates in this manner, it is made clear in whose best interest(s) the software is operating, through mechanisms such as a website use policy.

8.3 Personally Identifiable Information

This section is non-normative.

Data associated with verifiable credentials stored in the credential.credentialSubject property is susceptible to privacy violations when shared with verifiers. Personally identifying data, such as a government-issued identifier, shipping address, or full name, can be easily used to determine, track, and correlate an entity. Even information that does not seem personally identifiable, such as the combination of a birthdate and a postal code, has powerful correlation and de-anonymization capabilities.

Implementers of software used by holders are strongly advised to warn holders when they share data with these kinds of characteristics. Issuers are strongly advised to provide privacy-protecting verifiable credentials when possible — for example, by issuing ageOver verifiable credentials instead of dateOfBirth verifiable credentials for use when a verifier wants to determine whether an entity is at least 18 years of age.

Because a verifiable credential often contains personally identifiable information (PII), implementers are strongly advised to use mechanisms while storing and transporting verifiable credentials that protect the data from those who ought not have access to it. Mechanisms that could be considered include Transport Layer Security (TLS) or other means of encrypting the data while in transit, as well as encryption or access control mechanisms to protect the data in a verifiable credential when at rest.

Generally, individuals are advised to assume that a verifiable credential, like most physical credentials, will leak personally identifiable information when shared. To combat such leakage, verifiable credentials and their securing mechanisms need to be carefully designed to prevent correlation. Verifiable credentials specifically designed to protect against leakage of personally identifiable information are available. Individuals and implementers are encouraged to choose these credential types over those not designed to protect personally identifiable information.

8.4 Identifier-Based Correlation

This section is non-normative.

Verifiable credentials might contain long-lived identifiers that could be used to correlate individuals. These identifiers include subject identifiers, email addresses, government-issued identifiers, organization-issued identifiers, addresses, healthcare vitals, and many other long-lived identifiers. Implementers of software for holders are encouraged to detect identifiers in verifiable credentials that could be used to correlate individuals and to warn holders before they share this information. The rest of this section elaborates on guidance related to using long-lived identifiers.

Subjects of verifiable credentials are identified using the id property, as defined in Section 4.4 Identifiers and used in places such as the credentialSubject.id property. The identifiers used to identify a subject create a greater correlation risk when the identifiers are long-lived or used across more than one web domain. Other types of identifiers that fall into this category are email addresses, government-issued identifiers, and organization-issued identifiers.

Similarly, disclosing the credential identifier (as in Example 3) can lead to situations where multiple verifiers, or an issuer and a verifier, can collude to correlate the holder.

Holders aiming to reduce correlation are encouraged to use verifiable credentials from issuers that support selectively disclosing correlating identifiers in a verifiable presentation. Such approaches expect the holder to generate the identifier and might even allow hiding the identifier from the issuer through techniques like blind signatures, while still keeping the identifier embedded and signed in the verifiable credential.

Securing mechanism specification authors are advised to avoid enabling identifier-based correlation by designing their technologies to avoid the use of correlating identifiers that cannot be selectively disclosed.

If strong anti-correlation properties are required in a verifiable credentials system, it is essential that identifiers meet one or more of the following criteria:

Selectively disclosable
Bound to a single origin
Single-use
Not used and instead replaced by short-lived, single-use bearer tokens.
8.5 Signature-Based Correlation

This section is non-normative.

The contents of a verifiable credential are secured using a securing mechanism. Values representing the securing mechanism pose a greater risk of correlation when they remain the same across multiple sessions or domains. Examples of these include the following values:

the binary value of the digital signature
timestamp information associated with the creation of the digital signature
cryptographic material associated with the digital signature, such as a public key identifier

When strong anti-correlation properties are required, issuers are encouraged to produce verifiable credentials where signature values and metadata can be regenerated for each verifiable presentation. This can be achieved using technologies that support unlinkable disclosure, such as the Data Integrity BBS Cryptosuites v1.0 specification. When possible, verifiers are encouraged to prefer verifiable presentations that use this technology in order to enhance privacy for holders and subjects.

NOTE: Unlinkability is not a complete solution

Even with unlinkable signatures, a verifiable credential might contain other information that undermines the anti-correlation properties of the cryptography used. See Sections 8.3 Personally Identifiable Information, 8.4 Identifier-Based Correlation, 8.6 Metadata-based Correlation, 8.11 Correlation During Validation, and most other subsections of Section 8. Privacy Considerations.

8.6 Metadata-based Correlation

This section is non-normative.

Different extension points, such as those described in Section 4. Basic Concepts and Section 5. Advanced Concepts, can unintentionally or undesirably serve as a correlation mechanism, if relatively few issuers use a specific extension type or combination of types. For example, using certain cryptographic methods unique to particular nation-states, revocation formats specific to certain jurisdictions, or credential types employed by specific localities, can serve as mechanisms that reduce the pseudonymity a holder might expect when selectively disclosing information to a verifier.

Issuers are encouraged to minimize metadata-based correlation risks when issuing verifiable credentials intended for pseudonymous use by limiting the types of extensions that could reduce the holder's pseudonymity. Credential types, extensions, and technology profiles with global adoption are most preferable, followed by those with national use; those with only local use are least preferable.

8.7 Device Tracking and Fingerprinting

This section is non-normative.

There are mechanisms external to verifiable credentials that track and correlate individuals on the Internet and the Web. These mechanisms include Internet protocol (IP) address tracking, web browser fingerprinting, evercookies, advertising network trackers, mobile network position information, and in-application Global Positioning System (GPS) APIs. Using verifiable credentials cannot prevent the use of these other tracking technologies; rather, using these technologies alongside verifiable credentials can reveal new correlatable information. For instance, a birthdate combined with a GPS position can strongly correlate an individual across multiple websites.

Privacy-respecting systems ought to aim to prevent the combination of other tracking technologies with verifiable credentials. In some instances, tracking technologies might need to be disabled on devices that transmit verifiable credentials on behalf of a holder.

The Oblivious HTTP protocol [RFC9458] is one mechanism implementers might consider using when fetching external resources associated with a verifiable credential or a verifiable presentation. Oblivious HTTP allows a client to make multiple requests to an origin server without that server being able to link those requests to that client or even to identify those requests as having come from a single client, while placing only limited trust in the nodes used to forward the messages. Oblivious HTTP is one privacy-preserving mechanism that can reduce the possibility of device tracking and fingerprinting. Below are some concrete examples of ways that Oblivious HTTP can benefit ecosystem participants.

A holder using a digital wallet can reduce the chances that they will be tracked by a 3rd party when accessing external links within a verifiable credential stored in their digital wallet. For example, a digital wallet might fetch and render linked images, or it might check the validity of a verifiable credential by fetching an externally linked revocation list.
A verifier can reduce its likelihood of signaling to an issuer that the verifier has received a specific verifiable credential. For example, a verifier might fetch an externally linked revocation list while performing status checks on a verifiable credential.
8.8 Favor Abstract Claims

This section is non-normative.

Issuers are encouraged to limit the information included in a verifiable credential to the smallest set required for the intended purposes, so as to allow recipients to use them in various situations without disclosing more personally identifiable information (PII) than necessary. One way to avoid placing PII in a verifiable credential is to use an abstract property that meets the needs of verifiers without providing overly specific information about a subject.

For example, this document uses the ageOver property instead of a specific birthdate, which would represent more sensitive PII. If retailers in a particular market commonly require purchasers to be older than a certain age, an issuer trusted in that market might choose to offer verifiable credentials that claim that subjects have met that requirement rather than offering verifiable credentials that contain claims about the customers' birthdays. This practice enables individual customers to make purchases without disclosing more PII than necessary.

8.9 The Principle of Data Minimization

This section is non-normative.

Privacy violations occur when information divulged in one context leaks into another. One accepted best practice for preventing such a violation is for verifiers to limit the information requested and received, to the absolute minimum necessary for a particular transaction. Regulations in multiple jurisdictions, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, mandate this data minimization approach.

With verifiable credentials, data minimization for issuers means limiting the content of a verifiable credential to the minimum required by potential verifiers for expected use. For verifiers, data minimization means restricting the scope of information requested or required for accessing services.

For example, a driver's license containing a driver's ID number, height, weight, birthday, and home address expressed as a verifiable credential contains more information than is necessary to establish that the person is above a certain age.

It is considered best practice for issuers to atomize information or use a securing mechanism that allows for selective disclosure. For example, an issuer of driver's licenses could issue a verifiable credential containing every property that appears on a driver's license, and allow the holder to disclose each property selectively. It could also issue more abstract verifiable credentials (for example, a verifiable credential containing only an ageOver property). One possible adaptation would be for issuers to provide secure HTTP endpoints for retrieving single-use bearer credentials that promote the pseudonymous use of verifiable credentials. Implementers that find this impractical or unsafe might consider using selective disclosure schemes that eliminate dependence on issuers at proving time and reduce the risk of temporal correlation by issuers.

Verifiers are urged to only request information that is strictly necessary for a specific transaction to occur. This is important for at least two reasons:

It reduces the liability on the verifier for handling highly sensitive information that it does not need to handle.
It enhances the subject's and/or holder's privacy by only asking for information that is necessary for a specific transaction.

Implementers of software used by holders are encouraged to disclose the information being requested by a verifier, allowing the holder to decline to share specific information that is unnecessary for the transaction. Implementers of software used by holders are also advised to give holders access to logs of information shared with verifiers, enabling the holders to provide this information to authorities if they believe that they have been subjected to information overreach or coerced to share more information than necessary for a particular transaction.

NOTE: Minimum disclosure can still lead to unique identification

While it is possible to practice the principle of minimum disclosure, it might be impossible to avoid the strong identification of an individual for specific use cases during a single session or over multiple sessions. The authors of this document cannot stress how difficult it is to meet this principle in real-world scenarios.

8.10 Bearer Credentials

This section is non-normative.

A bearer credential is a privacy-enhancing piece of information, such as a concert ticket, that entitles its holder to a specific resource without requiring the holder to divulge sensitive information. In low-risk scenarios, entities often use bearer credentials where multiple holders presenting the same verifiable credential is not a concern or would not result in large economic or reputational losses.

Verifiable credentials that are bearer credentials are made possible by not specifying the subject identifier, expressed using the id property, which is nested in the credentialSubject property. For example, the following verifiable credential is a bearer credential:

EXAMPLE 35: Use of issuer properties
Credential
ecdsa
ecdsa-sd
bbs
jose
cose
sd-jwt
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/examples/v2"
  ],
  "id": "http://university.example/credentials/temporary/28934792387492384",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ExampleDegreeCredential"],
  "issuer": "https://university.example/issuers/14",
  "validFrom": "2017-10-22T12:23:48Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    // note that the 'id' property is not specified for bearer credentials
    "degree": {
      "type": "ExampleBachelorDegree",
      "name": "Bachelor of Science and Arts"
    }
  }
}

While bearer credentials are privacy-enhancing, issuers still need to take care in their design to avoid unintentionally divulging more information than the holder of the bearer credential expects. For example, repeated use of the same bearer credential across multiple sites can enable these sites to collude in illicitly tracking or correlating the holder. Similarly, information that might seem non-identifying, such as a birthdate and postal code, can be used together to statistically identify an individual when used in the same bearer credential or session.

Issuers of bearer credentials should ensure that the bearer credentials provide privacy-enhancing benefits that:

Are single-use, where possible.
Do not contain personally identifying information.
Are not unduly correlatable.

Holders ought to be warned by their software if it detects that bearer credentials containing sensitive information have been issued or requested, or that a correlation risk is posed by the combination of two or more bearer credentials across one or more sessions. While detecting all correlation risks might be impossible, some might certainly be detectable.

Verifiers ought not request bearer credentials known to carry information which can be used to illicitly correlate the holder.

8.11 Correlation During Validation

This section is non-normative.

When processing verifiable credentials, verifiers evaluate relevant claims before relying upon them. This evaluation might be done in any manner desired as long as it satisfies the requirements of the verifier doing the validation. Many verifiers will perform the checks listed in Appendix A. Validation as well as a variety of specific business process checks such as:

The professional licensure status of the holder.
A date of license renewal or revocation.
The sub-qualifications of an individual.
If a relationship exists between the holder and the entity with whom the holder is attempting to interact.
The geolocation information associated with the holder.

The process of performing these checks might result in information leakage that leads to a privacy violation of the holder. For example, a simple operation, such as checking an improperly configured revocation list, can notify the issuer that a specific business is likely interacting with the holder. This could enable issuers to collude to correlate individuals without their knowledge.

Issuers are urged to not use mechanisms, such as credential revocation lists that are unique per credential, during the verification process, which could lead to privacy violations. Organizations providing software to holders ought to warn when credentials include information that could lead to privacy violations during the verification process. Verifiers are urged to consider rejecting credentials that produce privacy violations or that enable substandard privacy practices.

8.12 Storage Providers and Data Mining

This section is non-normative.

When a holder receives a verifiable credential from an issuer, the verifiable credential needs to be stored somewhere (for example, in a credential repository). Holders need to be aware that the information in a verifiable credential can be sensitive and highly individualized, making it a prime target for data mining. Services offering "free of charge" storage of verifiable credentials might mine personal data and sell it to organizations interesting in building individualized profiles on people and organizations.

Holders need to be aware of the terms of service for their credential repository, specifically the correlation and data mining protections in place for those who store their verifiable credentials with the service provider.

Some effective mitigations for data mining and profiling include using:

Service providers that do not sell your information to third parties.
Software that encrypts verifiable credentials such that a service provider cannot view the contents of the credential.
Software that stores verifiable credentials locally on a device that you control and that does not upload or analyze your information beyond your expectations.

In addition to the mitigations above, civil society and regulatory participation in vendor analysis and auditing can help ensure that legal protections are enacted and enforced for individuals affected by practices that are not aligned with their best interests.

8.13 Aggregation of Credentials

This section is non-normative.

Having two pieces of information about the same subject often reveals more about the subject than the combination of those two pieces, even when the pieces are delivered through different channels. Aggregating verifiable credentials poses a privacy risk, and all participants in the ecosystem need to be aware of the risks of data aggregation.

For example, suppose two bearer credentials, one for an email address and one stating the holder is over 21, are provided to the same verifier across multiple sessions. The verifier of the information now has a unique identifier (the email address) along with age-related ("over 21") information for that individual. It is now easy to create a profile for the holder, building it by adding more and more information as it leaks over time. Aggregation of such credentials can also be performed by multiple sites in collusion with each other, leading to privacy violations.

From a technological perspective, preventing information aggregation is a challenging privacy problem. While new cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs, are being proposed as solutions to aggregation and correlation issues, the existence of long-lived identifiers and browser-tracking techniques defeats even the most modern cryptographic techniques.

The solution to the privacy implications of correlation or aggregation tends not to be technological in nature, but policy-driven instead. Therefore, if a holder wishes to avoid the aggregation of their information, they need to express this in the verifiable presentations they transmit, and by the holders and verifiers to whom they transmit their verifiable presentations.

8.14 Patterns of Use

This section is non-normative.

Despite best efforts by all involved to assure privacy, using verifiable credentials can potentially lead to de-anonymization and a loss of privacy. This correlation can occur when any of the following occurs:

The same verifiable credential is presented to the same verifier more than once. The verifier could infer that the holder is the same individual.
The same verifiable credential is presented to different verifiers, and either those verifiers collude, or a third party has access to transaction records from both verifiers. An observant party could infer that the individual presenting the verifiable credential is the same person at both services. That is, the same person controls both accounts.
A subject identifier of a credential refers to the same subject across multiple presentations or verifiers. Even when different credentials are presented, if the subject identifier is the same, verifiers (and those with access to verifier logs) could infer that the credentials' subjects are the same entity.
The underlying information in a credential can be used to identify an individual across services. In this case, using information from other sources (including information provided directly by the holder), verifiers can use information inside the credential to correlate the individual with an existing profile. For example, if a holder presents credentials that include postal code, age, and gender, a verifier can potentially correlate the subject of that credential with an established profile. For more information, see [DEMOGRAPHICS].
Passing the identifier of a credential to a centralized revocation server. The centralized server can correlate uses of the credential across interactions. For example, if a credential is used to prove age in this manner, the centralized service could know everywhere that credential was presented (all liquor stores, bars, adult stores, lottery sellers, and so on).

In part, it is possible to mitigate this de-anonymization and loss of privacy by:

The holder software providing a globally-unique identifier as the subject for any given verifiable credential and never reusing that verifiable credential.
The issuer using a globally-distributed service for revocation such that it is not contacted when revocation checks are performed.
Specification authors designing revocation mechanisms that do not depend on submitting a unique identifier for a verifiable credential to a query API, and instead use, for example, a privacy-preserving revocation list.
Issuers avoiding the association of personally identifiable information with any specific long-lived subject identifier.

Unfortunately, these mitigation techniques are only sometimes practical or even compatible with necessary use. Sometimes, correlation is a requirement.

For example, in some prescription drug monitoring programs, monitoring prescription use is a requirement. Enforcement entities need to be able to confirm that individuals are not cheating the system to get multiple prescriptions for controlled substances. This statutory or regulatory need to correlate prescription use overrides individual privacy concerns.

Verifiable credentials will also be used to intentionally correlate individuals across services. For example, when using a common persona to log in to multiple services, all activity on each of those services is intentionally linked to the same individual. This is not a privacy issue as long as each of those services uses the correlation in the expected manner.

Privacy violations related to the use of verifiable credentials occur when unintended or unexpected correlation arises from the presentation of those verifiable credentials.

8.15 Legal Processes

This section is non-normative.

Legal processes can compel issuers, holders, and verifiers to disclose private information to authorities, such as law enforcement. It is also possible for the same private information to be accidentally disclosed to an unauthorized party through a software bug or security failure. Authors of legal processes and compliance regimes are advised to draft guidelines that require notifying the subjects involved when their private information is intentionally or accidentally disclosed to a third party. Providers of software services are advised to be transparent about known circumstances that might cause such private information to be shared with a third party, as well as the identity of any such third party.

8.16 Sharing Information with the Wrong Party

This section is non-normative.

When a holder chooses to share information with a verifier, it might be the case that the verifier is acting in bad faith and requests information that could harm the holder. For example, a verifier might ask for a bank account number, which could then be used with other information to defraud the holder or the bank.

Issuers ought to strive to tokenize as much information as possible so that if a holder accidentally transmits credentials to the wrong verifier, the situation is not catastrophic.

For example, instead of including a bank account number to check an individual's bank balance, provide a token that enables the verifier to check if the balance is above a certain amount. In this case, the bank could issue a verifiable credential containing a balance checking token to a holder. The holder would then include the verifiable credential in a verifiable presentation and bind the token to a credit checking agency using a digital signature. The verifier could then wrap the verifiable presentation in their digital signature and hand it back to the issuer to check the account balance dynamically.

Using this approach, even if a holder shares the account balance token with the wrong party, an attacker cannot discover the bank account number or the exact value of the account. Also, given the validity period of the counter-signature, the attacker gains access to the token for only a few minutes.

8.17 Data Theft

This section is non-normative.

The data expressed in verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations are valuable since they contain authentic statements made by trusted third parties (such as issuers) or individuals (such as holders or subjects). The storage and accessibility of this data can inadvertently create honeypots of sensitive data for malicious actors. These adversaries often seek to exploit such reservoirs of sensitive information, aiming to acquire and exchange that data for financial gain.

Issuers are advised to retain the minimum amount of data necessary to issue verifiable credentials to holders and to manage the status and revocation of those credentials. Similarly, issuers are advised to avoid creating publicly accessible credentials that include personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data. Software implementers are advised to safeguard verifiable credentials using robust consent and access control measures, ensuring that they remain inaccessible to unauthorized entities.

Holders are advised to use implementations that appropriately encrypt their data in transit and at rest and protect sensitive material (such as cryptographic secrets) in ways that cannot be easily extracted from hardware or other devices. It is further suggested that holders store and manipulate their data only on devices they control, away from centralized systems, to reduce the likelihood of an attack on their data or inclusion in a large-scale theft if an attack is successful. Furthermore, holders are encouraged to rigorously control access to their credentials and presentations, allowing access only to those with explicit authorization.

Verifiers are advised to ask only for data necessary for a particular transaction and to retain no data beyond the needs of any particular transaction.

Regulators are advised to reconsider existing audit requirements such that mechanisms that better preserve privacy can be used to achieve similar enforcement and audit capabilities. For example, audit-focused regulations that insist on the collection and long-term retention of personally identifiable information can cause harm to individuals and organizations if that same information is later compromised and accessed by an attacker. The technologies described by this specification enable holders to prove properties about themselves and others more readily, reducing the need for long-term data retention by verifiers. Alternatives include keeping logs that the information was collected and checked, as well as random tests to ensure that compliance regimes are operating as expected.

8.18 Frequency of Claim Issuance

This section is non-normative.

As detailed in Section 8.14 Patterns of Use, patterns of use can be correlated with certain types of behavior. This correlation is partially mitigated when a holder uses a verifiable credential without the knowledge of the issuer. Issuers can defeat this protection however, by making their verifiable credentials short lived and renewal automatic.

For example, an ageOver verifiable credential is helpful in gaining access to a bar. If an issuer issues such a verifiable credential with a very short validity period and an automatic renewal mechanism, then the issuer could correlate the holder's behavior in a way that negatively impacts the holder.

Organizations providing software to holders ought to warn them if they repeatedly use credentials with short lifespans, which could result in behavior correlation. Issuers ought to avoid issuing credentials that enable them to correlate patterns of use.

8.19 Prefer Single-Use Credentials

This section is non-normative.

An ideal privacy-respecting system would require only the information necessary for interaction with the verifier to be disclosed by the holder. The verifier then records that the disclosure requirement has been met and discards any sensitive information disclosed. In many cases, competing priorities, such as regulatory burden, prevent this ideal system from being employed. In other instances, long-lived identifiers prevent single use. The designer of any verifiable credentials ecosystem ought to strive to make it as privacy-respecting as possible by preferring single-use verifiable credentials whenever possible.

Using single-use verifiable credentials provides several benefits. The first benefit is to verifiers who can be sure that the data in a verifiable credential is fresh. The second benefit is to holders, who know that if there are no long-lived identifiers in the verifiable credential, the verifiable credential itself cannot be used to track or correlate them online. Finally, there is nothing for attackers to steal, making the entire ecosystem safer to operate within.

8.20 Private Browsing

This section is non-normative.

In an ideal private browsing scenario, no PII will be revealed. Because many credentials include PII, organizations providing software to holders ought to warn them about the possibility of this information being revealed if they use credentials and presentations while in private browsing mode. As each browser vendor handles private browsing differently, and some browsers might not have this feature, it is important that implementers not depend on private browsing mode to provide any privacy protections. Instead, implementers are advised to rely on tooling that directly usable by their software to provide privacy guarantees.

8.21 Issuer Cooperation Impacts on Privacy

This section is non-normative.

Verifiable credentials rely on a high degree of trust in issuers. The degree to which a holder might take advantage of possible privacy protections often depends strongly on the support an issuer provides for such features. In many cases, privacy protections which make use of zero-knowledge proofs, data minimization techniques, bearer credentials, abstract claims, and protections against signature-based correlation require active support by the issuer, who need to incorporate those capabilities into the verifiable credentials they issue.

It is crucial to note that holders not only depend on issuer participation to provide verifiable credential capabilities that help preserve holder and subject privacy, but also rely on issuers to not deliberately subvert these privacy protections. For example, an issuer might sign verifiable credentials using a signature scheme that protects against signature-based correlation. This would protect the holder from being correlated by the signature value as it is shared among verifiers. However, if the issuer creates a unique key for each issued credential, it might be possible for the issuer to track presentations of the credential, regardless of a verifier's inability to do so.

In addition to previously described privacy protections an issuer might offer, issuers need to be aware of data they leak that is associated with identifiers and claim types they use when issuing credentials. One example of this would be an issuer issuing driver's licenses which reveal both the location(s) in which they have jurisdiction and the location of the subject's residence. Verifiers might take advantage of this by requesting a credential to check that the subject is licensed to drive when, in fact, they are interested in metadata about the credential, such as which issuer issued the credential, and tangential information that might have been leaked by the issuer, such as the subject's home address. To mitigate such leakage, issuers might use common identifiers to mask specific location information or other sensitive metadata; for example, a shared issuer identifier at a state or national level instead of at the level of a county, city, town, or other smaller municipality. Further, verifiers can use holder attestation mechanisms to preserve privacy, by providing proof that an issuer exists in a set of trusted entities without needing to disclose the exact issuer.

9. Security Considerations

This section is non-normative.

Issuers, holders, and verifiers should be aware of a number of security considerations when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can result in security vulnerabilities.

While this section highlights a broad set of security considerations, it is a partial list. Implementers of mission-critical systems using the technology described in this specification are strongly encouraged to consult security and cryptography professionals for comprehensive guidance.

9.1 Cryptography Suites and Libraries

This section is non-normative.

Cryptography can protect some aspects of the data model described in this specification. It is important for implementers to understand the cryptography suites and libraries used to create and process credentials and presentations. Implementing and auditing cryptography systems generally requires substantial experience. Effective red teaming can also help remove bias from security reviews.

Cryptography suites and libraries have a shelf life and eventually succumb to new attacks and technological advances. Production quality systems need to take this into account and ensure mechanisms exist to easily and proactively upgrade expired or broken cryptography suites and libraries, and to invalidate and replace existing credentials. Regular monitoring is important to ensure the long term viability of systems processing credentials.

9.2 Key Management

This section is non-normative.

The security of most digital signature algorithms, used to secure verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, depends on the quality and protection of their private signing keys. The management of cryptographic keys encompasses a vast and complex field. For comprehensive recommendations and in-depth discussion, readers are directed to [NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1]. As strongly recommended in both [FIPS-186-5] and [NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1], a private signing key is not to be used for multiple purposes; for example, a private signing key is not to be used for encryption as well as signing.

[NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1] strongly advises that private signing keys and public verification keys have limited cryptoperiods, where a cryptoperiod is "the time span during which a specific key is authorized for use by legitimate entities or the keys for a given system will remain in effect." [NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1] gives extensive guidance on cryptoperiods for different key types under various conditions and recommends a one to three year cryptoperiod for a private signing key.

To deal with potential private key compromises, [NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1] provides recommendations for protective measures, harm reduction, and revocation. Although this section focuses primarily on the security of the private signing key, [NIST-SP-800-57-Part-1] also highly recommends confirmation of the validity of all verification material before using it.

9.3 Content Integrity Protection

This section is non-normative.

Verifiable credentials often contain URLs to data that resides outside the verifiable credential. Linked content that exists outside a verifiable credential — such as images, JSON-LD extension contexts, JSON Schemas, and other machine-readable data — is not protected against tampering because the data resides outside of the protection of the securing mechanism on the verifiable credential.

Section 5.3 Integrity of Related Resources of this specification provides an optional mechanism for ensuring the integrity of the content of external resources. This mechanism is not necessary for external resources that do not impact the verifiable credential's security. However, its implementation is crucial for external resources where content changes could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities.

Implementers need to recognize the potential security risks associated with unprotected URLs of external machine-readable content. Such vulnerabilities could lead to successful attacks on their applications. Where changes to external resources might compromise security, implementers will benefit by employing the content integrity protection mechanism outlined in this specification.

9.4 Unsigned Claims

This section is non-normative.

This specification enables the creation of credentials without signatures or proofs. These credential classes are often useful for intermediate storage or self-asserted information, analogous to filling out a form on a web page. Implementers ought to be aware that these credential types are not verifiable because the authorship either is unknown or cannot be trusted.

9.5 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), Replay, and Cloning Attacks

This section is non-normative.

The data model does not inherently prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), replay, and spoofing attacks. Both online and offline use cases might be susceptible to these attacks, where an adversary intercepts, modifies, re-uses, and/or replicates the verifiable credential data during transmission or storage.

9.5.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

A verifier might need to ensure it is the intended recipient of a verifiable presentation and not the target of a man-in-the-middle attack. Some securing mechanisms, like Securing Verifiable Credentials using JOSE and COSE [VC-JOSE-COSE] and Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY], provide an option to specify a presentation's intended audience or domain, which can help reduce this risk.

Other approaches, such as token binding [RFC8471], which ties the request for a verifiable presentation to the response, can help secure the protocol. Any unsecured protocol is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

9.5.2 Replay Attack

A verifier might wish to limit the number of times that verifiable presentation can be used. For example, multiple individuals presenting the same verifiable credential representing an event ticket might be granted entry to the event, undermining the purpose of the ticket from the perspective of its issuer. To prevent such replay attacks, verifiers require holders to include additional security measures in their verifiable presentations. Examples include the following:

A challenge provided by the verifier, which the holder incorporates into a verifiable presentation. The verifier enforces challenge uniqueness to prevent replay attacks.
A validity period, limiting the window during which the verifiable presentation is valid.

9.5.3 Spoofing Attack

Verifiers might have a vested interest in knowing that a holder is authorized to present the claims inside of a verifiable presentation. While the data model outlines the structure and data elements necessary for a verifiable credential, it does not include a mechanism to ascertain the authorization of presented credentials. To address this concern, implementers might need to explore supplementary methods, such as binding verifiable credentials to strong authentication mechanisms or using additional properties in verifiable presentations to enable proof of control.

9.6 Bundling Dependent Claims

This section is non-normative.

It is considered best practice for issuers to atomize information in a credential or use a signature scheme that allows for selective disclosure. When atomizing information, if it is not done securely by the issuers, the holders might bundle together claims from different credentials in ways that the issuers did not intend.

Consider a university issuing two verifiable credentials to an individual. Each credential contains two properties that, when combined, indicate the person's "role" in a specific "department." For instance, one credential pair might designate "Staff Member" in the "Department of Computing," while another could signify "Post Graduate Student" in the "Department of Economics." Atomizing these verifiable credentials results in the university issuing four separate credentials to the individual. Each credential contains a single designation: "Staff Member", "Post Graduate Student", "Department of Computing", or "Department of Economics". The holder might then present the "Staff Member" and "Department of Economics" verifiable credentials to a verifier, which, together, would comprise a false claim.

9.7 Highly Dynamic Information

This section is non-normative.

When verifiable credentials contain highly dynamic information, careful consideration of validity periods becomes crucial. Issuing verifiable credentials with validity periods that extend beyond their intended use creates potential security vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. Validity periods shorter than the timeframe where the information expressed by the verifiable credential is expected to be used creates a burden on holders and verifiers. It is, therefore, important to set validity periods for verifiable credentials appropriate to the use case and the expected lifetime of the information contained in the verifiable credential.

9.8 Device Theft and Impersonation

This section is non-normative.

Storing verifiable credentials on a device poses risks if the device is lost or stolen. An attacker gaining possession of such a device potentially acquires unauthorized access to systems using the victim's verifiable credentials. Ways to mitigate this type of attack include:

Enabling password, pin, pattern, or biometric screen unlock protection on the device.
Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication for the credential repository.
Enabling password, biometric, or multi-factor authentication when accessing cryptographic keys.
Using a separate hardware-based signature device.
All or any combination of the above.

Furthermore, instances of impersonation can manifest in various forms, including situations where an entity attempts to disavow its actions. Elevating trust and security within the realm of verifiable credentials entails more than averting impersonation; it also involves implementing non-repudiation mechanisms. These mechanisms solidify an entity's responsibility for its actions or transactions, reinforcing accountability and deterring malicious behavior. Attainment of non-repudiation is a multifaceted endeavor, encompassing an array of techniques including securing mechanisms, proofs of possession, and authentication schemes in various protocols designed to foster trust and reliability.

9.9 Acceptable Use

This section is non-normative.

Ensuring alignment between an entity's actions — such as presentation, and the intended purpose of those actions — is essential. It involves having the authorization to use verifiable credentials and using credentials in a manner that adheres to their designated scope(s) and objective(s). Two critical aspects in this context are Unauthorized Use and Inappropriate Use.

9.9.1 Unauthorized Use

Entities using verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations beyond their intended purpose are engaging in unauthorized activity. One class of unauthorized use is a confidentiality violation. Consider a holder that shares a verifiable presentation with a verifier to establish their age and residency status. If the verifier then proceeds to employ the holder's data without proper consent, such as by selling the data to a data broker, that would constitute an unauthorized use of the data, violating an expectation of privacy that the holder might have in the transaction.

Similarly, an issuer can employ a termsOfUse property to specify how and when a holder might be permitted and expected to use a credential. A holder using credentials outside of the scope(s) defined in the termsOfUse would be considered to be unauthorized.

NOTE: Digital Rights Management is out of scope

Further study is required to determine how a holder can assert and enforce authorized use of their data after presentation.

9.9.2 Inappropriate Use

While valid cryptographic signatures and successful status checks signify the reliability of credentials, they do not signify that all credentials are interchangeable for all contexts. It is crucial that verifiers also validate any relevant claims, considering the source and nature of the claim alongside the purpose for which the holder presents the credential.

For instance, in scenarios where a certified medical diagnosis is required, a self-asserted credential carrying the necessary data might not suffice because it lacks validity from an authoritative medical source. To ensure proper credential use, stakeholders need to assess the credential's relevance and authority within the specific context of their intended application.

9.10 Code Injection

This section is non-normative.

Data in verifiable credentials can include injectable code or code from scripting languages. Authors of verifiable credentials benefit from avoiding such inclusions unless necessary and only after mitigating associated risks to the fullest extent possible.

For example, a single natural language string containing multiple languages or annotations often requires additional structure or markup for correct presentation. Markup languages, such as HTML, can label text spans in different languages or supply string-internal markup needed to display bidirectional text properly. It is also possible to use the rdf:HTML datatype to encode such values accurately in JSON-LD.

Despite the ability to encode information as HTML, implementers are strongly discouraged from doing so for the following reasons:

It requires some version of an HTML processor, which increases the burden of processing language and base direction information.
It increases the security attack surface when using this data model, because naively processing HTML could result in the execution of a script tag that an attacker injected at some point during the data production process.

If implementers feel they need to use HTML, or other markup languages capable of containing executable scripts, to address a specific use case, they are advised to analyze how an attacker could use the markup to mount injection attacks against a consumer of the markup. This analysis should be followed by the proactive deployment of mitigations against the identified attacks, such as running the HTML rendering engine in a sandbox with no ability to access the network.

10. Accessibility Considerations

This section is non-normative.

There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with implementation of any web standard or protocol, ignoring accessibility issues makes this information unusable by a large subset of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [WCAG21], to ensure that all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when establishing systems using cryptography, which have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into account when using this data model.

10.1 Data First Approaches

This section is non-normative.

Many physical credentials in use today, such as government identification cards, have poor accessibility characteristics, including, but not limited to, small print, reliance on small and high-resolution images, and no affordances for people with vision impairments.

When using this data model to create verifiable credentials, it is suggested that data model designers use a data first approach. For example, given the choice of using data or a graphical image to depict a credential, designers should express every element of the image, such as the name of an institution or the professional credential, in a machine-readable way instead of relying on a viewer's interpretation of the image to convey this information. Using a data first approach is preferred because it provides the foundational elements of building different interfaces for people with varying abilities.

11. Internationalization Considerations

This section is non-normative.

Implementers are advised to be aware of a number of internationalization considerations when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which limits the applicability of the specification and significantly diminishes its value as a standard.

Implementers are strongly advised to read the Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata document [STRING-META], published by the W3C Internationalization Activity, which elaborates on the need to provide reliable metadata about text to support internationalization. For the latest information on internationalization considerations, implementers are also urged to read the Verifiable Credentials Implementation Guidelines [VC-IMP-GUIDE] document.

This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into account when using this data model and is intended to highlight specific parts of the Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata document [STRING-META] that implementers might be interested in reading.

11.1 Language and Base Direction

Data publishers are strongly encouraged to read the section on Cross-Syntax Expression in the Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata document [STRING-META] to ensure that expressing language and base direction information is possible across multiple expression syntaxes, such as [JSON-LD11], [JSON], and CBOR [RFC7049].

The general design pattern is to use the following markup template when expressing a text string that is tagged with a language and, optionally, a specific base direction.

EXAMPLE 36: Design pattern for natural language strings
"myProperty": {
  "@value": "The string value",
  "@language": "LANGUAGE"
  "@direction": "DIRECTION"
}

When the language value object is used in place of a string value, the object MUST contain a @value property whose value is a string, and SHOULD contain a @language property whose value is a string containing a well-formed Language-Tag as defined by [BCP47], and MAY contain a @direction property whose value is a base direction string defined by the @direction property in [JSON-LD11]. The language value object MUST NOT include any other keys beyond @value, @language, and @direction.

Using the design pattern above, the following example expresses the title of a book in the English language without specifying a text direction.

EXAMPLE 37: Expressing natural language text as English
"title": {
  "@value": "HTML and CSS: Designing and Creating Websites",
  "@language": "en"
}

The next example uses a similar title expressed in the Arabic language with a base direction of right-to-left.

EXAMPLE 38: Arabic text with a base direction of right-to-left
"title": {
  "@value": "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
  "@language": "ar",
  "@direction": "rtl"
}
NOTE: Properly rendering internationalized text is challenging

The text above would most likely be rendered incorrectly as left-to-right without the explicit expression of language and direction because many systems use the first character of a text string to determine its base direction.

Multiple language value objects MAY be provided as an array value for the property:

EXAMPLE 39: Multiple language texts provided for title
"title": [
  {
    "@value": "HTML and CSS: Designing and Creating Websites",
    "@language": "en"
  },
  {
    "@value": "HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب",
    "@language": "ar",
    "@direction": "rtl"
  }
]
EXAMPLE 40: Example dual language credential
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://achievement.example/multilingual/v2"
  ],

11.2 Providing Default Language and Direction

The language and base direction of each natural language string property value SHOULD be provided, either via the language value structure for each property value, or via a default language and base direction for all values in the entire credential. Using the per-value language value structure is preferred, because using document defaults can result in a requirement that downstream processors perform JSON-LD expansion-based transformation which is otherwise optional. See the String Internationalization section of the [JSON-LD11] specification for more information. Natural language string values that do not have a language associated with them SHOULD be treated as if the language value is undefined (language tag "und"). Natural language string values that do not have a base direction associated with them SHOULD be treated as if the direction value is "auto".

A. Validation

This section is non-normative.

While this specification does not provide conformance criteria for the process of the validation of verifiable credentials or verifiable presentations, readers might be curious about how the information in this data model is expected to be used by verifiers during the process of validation. This section captures a selection of conversations held by the Working Group related to the expected use of the properties in this specification by verifiers.

A.1 Credential Type

This section is non-normative.

When a verifier requests one or more verifiable credentials from a holder, they can specify the type of credential(s) that they would like to receive. Credential types, as well as validation schemas for each type and each of their claims, are defined by specification authors and are published in places like the Verifiable Credential Extensions.

The type of a credential is expressed via the type property. A verifiable credential of a specific type contains specific properties (which might be deeply nested) that can be used to determine whether or not the presentation satisfies a set of processing rules that the verifier executes. By requesting verifiable credentials of a particular type, the verifier is able to gather specific information from the holder, which originated with the issuer of each verifiable credential, that will enable the verifier to determine the next stage of an interaction with a holder.

When a verifier requests a verifiable credential of a specific type, there will be a set of mandatory and optional claims that are associated with that type. A verifier's validation of a verifiable credential will fail when mandatory claims are not included, and any claim that is not associated with the specific type will be ignored. In other words, a verifier will perform input validation on the verifiable credential it receives and will reject malformed input based on the credential type specification.

A.2 Credential Subject

This section is non-normative.

In the verifiable credentials presented by a holder, the value associated with the id property for each credentialSubject identifies a subject to the verifier. If the holder is also the subject, then the verifier could authenticate the holder if they have verification metadata related to the holder. The verifier could then authenticate the holder using a signature generated by the holder contained in the verifiable presentation. The id property is optional. Verifiers could use other properties in a verifiable credential to uniquely identify a subject.

NOTE: Authentication is out of scope

For information on how authentication and WebAuthn might work with verifiable credentials, see the Verifiable Credentials Implementation Guidelines 1.0 document.

A.3 Issuer

This section is non-normative.

The value associated with the issuer property identifies an issuer to the verifier.

Metadata related to the issuer property is available to the verifier through the verification algorithm as defined in Section 7.1 Verification. This metadata includes identification of the verified controller of the verification method used by the securing mechanism to secure each verifiable credential or verifiable presentation, of which the controller is typically the respective issuer or holder.

Some ecosystems might have more complex relationships between issuers and controllers of verification methods and might use lists of verified issuers in addition to, or instead of, the mapping described above.

A.4 Holder

This section is non-normative.

The value associated with the holder property is used to identify the holder to the verifier.

Often relevant metadata about the holder, as identified by the value of the holder property, is available to, or retrievable by, the verifier. For example, a holder can publish information containing the verification material used to secure verifiable presentations. This metadata is used when checking proofs on verifiable presentations. Some cryptographic identifiers contain all necessary metadata in the identifier itself. In those cases, no additional metadata is required. Other identifiers use verifiable data registries where such metadata is automatically published for use by verifiers, without any additional action by the holder.

See the Verifiable Credentials Implementation Guidelines 1.0 and Verifiable Credentials Use Cases for additional examples related to subject and holder.

NOTE: Validation is the process of applying business rules

Validation is the process by which verifiers apply business rules to evaluate the propriety of a particular use of a verifiable credential.

A verifier might need to validate a given verifiable presentation against complex business rules; for example, the verifier might need confidence that the holder is the same entity as a subject of a verifiable credential. In such a situation, the following factors can provide a verifier with reasonable confidence that the claims expressed regarding that identifier, in included verifiable credentials, are, in fact, about the current presenter:

The verifiable presentation is secured, using a mechanism the verifier trusts to protect the integrity of the content.
The verifiable presentation includes one or more verifiable credentials that are secured, using a mechanism the verifier trusts to protect the integrity of the content.
The identifier in the holder property of the verifiable presentation and at least one identifier property of at least one object in the credentialSubject array are the same.
That common identifier can be used to discover or derive the verification material used to verify the integrity of that verifiable presentation.
A.5 Issuance Date

This section is non-normative.

The validFrom is expected to be within an expected range for the verifier. For example, a verifier can check that the start of the validity period for a verifiable credential is not in the future.

A.6 Proofs (Signatures)

This section is non-normative.

The securing mechanism used to prove that the information in a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation was not tampered with is called a cryptographic proof. There are many types of cryptographic proofs including, but not limited to, digital signatures and zero-knowledge proofs. In general, when verifying cryptographic proofs, implementations are expected to ensure:

The cryptographic proof is available in a form defined by a known cryptographic suite.
All required cryptographic proof properties are present.
The cryptographic proof verification algorithm, when applied to the data, results in an accepted cryptographic proof.

In general, when verifying digital signatures, implementations are expected to ensure:

Acceptably recent metadata regarding the verification material associated with the signature is available. For example, if the verification material is a cryptographic public key, the metadata might include properties related to the validity period, the controller, or the authorized purpose, such as authentication or encryption, of the cryptographic public key.
The public key is not suspended, revoked, or expired.
The digital signature verifies.
Any additional requirements defined by the securing mechanism are satisfied.
A.7 Validity Periods

This section is non-normative.

The verifier expects that the validFrom and validUntil properties will be within a certain range. For example, a verifier can check that the end of the validity period of a verifiable credential is not in the past. Because some credentials can be useful for secondary purposes even if their original validity period has expired, validity period, as expressed using the validFrom and validUntil properties, is always considered a component of validation, which is performed after verification.

A.8 Status

This section is non-normative.

If the credentialStatus property is available, the status of a verifiable credential is expected to be evaluated by the verifier according to the credentialStatus type definition for the verifiable credential and the verifier's own status evaluation criteria. For example, a verifier can ensure the status of the verifiable credential is not "withdrawn for cause by the issuer".

A.9 Schema

This section is non-normative.

If the credentialSchema property is available, the schema of a verifiable credential is expected to be evaluated by the verifier according to the credentialSchema type definition for the verifiable credential and the verifier's own schema evaluation criteria. For example, if the credentialSchema's type value is [VC-JSON-SCHEMA], then a verifier can ensure a credential's data is valid against the given JSON Schema.

A.10 Fitness for Purpose

This section is non-normative.

Fitness for purpose is about whether the custom properties in the verifiable credential are appropriate for the verifier's purpose. For example, if a verifier needs to determine whether a subject is older than 21 years of age, they might rely on a specific birthdate property, or on more abstract properties, such as ageOver.

The issuer is trusted by the verifier to make the claims at hand. For example, a franchised fast food restaurant location trusts the discount coupon claims made by the corporate headquarters of the franchise. Policy information expressed by the issuer in the verifiable credential should be respected by holders and verifiers unless they accept the liability of ignoring the policy.

A.11 "Artificial Intelligence" and "Machine Learning"

This section is non-normative.

Systems using what is today commonly referred to as "artificial intelligence" and/or "machine learning" might be capable of performing complex tasks at a level that meets or exceeds human performance. This might include tasks such as the acquisition and use of verifiable credentials. Using such tasks to distinguish between human and automated "bot" activity, as is commonly done today with a CAPTCHA, for instance, might thereby cease to provide adequate or acceptable protection.

Implementers of security architectures that use verifiable credentials and/or perform validation on their content are urged to consider the existence of machine-based actors, such as those which are today commonly referred to as "artificial intelligence", that might legitimately hold verifiable credentials for use in interactions with other systems. Implementers might also consider how threat actors could couple such "artificial intelligence" systems with verifiable credentials to pose as humans when interacting with their systems. Such systems might include, but not be limited to, global infrastructure such as social media, election, energy distribution, supply chain, and autonomous vehicle systems.

B. Contexts, Vocabularies, Types, and Credential Schemas
B.1 Base Context

Implementations MUST treat the base context value, located at https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2, as already retrieved; the following value is the hexadecimal encoded SHA2-256 digest value of the base context file: 59955ced6697d61e03f2b2556febe5308ab16842846f5b586d7f1f7adec92734. It is possible to confirm the cryptographic digest above by running the following command from a modern Unix command interface line: curl -s https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2 | openssl dgst -sha256.

It is strongly advised that all JSON-LD Context URLs used by an application use the same mechanism, or a functionally equivalent mechanism, to ensure end-to-end security. Implementations are expected to throw errors if a cryptographic hash value for a resource does not match the expected hash value.

Implementations that apply the base context above, as well as other contexts and values in any @context property, during operations such as JSON-LD Expansion or transformation to RDF, are expected to do so without experiencing any errors. If such operations are performed and result in an error, the verifiable credential or verifiable presentation MUST result in a verification failure.

NOTE: See errata if hash value changes are detected

It is extremely unlikely that the files that have associated cryptographic hash values in this specification will change. However, if critical errata are found in the specification and corrections are required to ensure ecosystem stability, the cryptographic hash values might change. As such, the HTTP cache times for the files are not set to infinity and implementers are advised to check for errata if a cryptographic hash value change is detected.

This section serves as a reminder of the importance of ensuring that, when verifying verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, the verifier has information that is consistent with what the issuer or holder had when securing the credential or presentation. This information might include at least:

The contents of the credential itself, which are secured in verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations by using securing mechanisms. See Section 4.12 Securing Mechanisms for further information.
The content in a credential whose meaning depends on a link to an external URL, such as a JSON-LD Context, which can be secured by using a local static copy or a cryptographic digest of the file. See Section 5.3 Integrity of Related Resources for more details.

Verifiers are warned that other data that is referenced from within a credential, such as resources that are linked to via URLs, are not cryptographically protected by default. It is considered a best practice to ensure that the same sorts of protections are provided for any URL that is critical to the security of the verifiable credential through the use of permanently cached files and/or cryptographic hashes. Ultimately, knowing the cryptographic digest of any linked external content enables a verifier to confirm that the content is the same as what the issuer or holder intended.

B.2 Vocabularies

Implementations that depend on RDF vocabulary processing MUST ensure that the following vocabulary URLs used in the base context ultimately resolve to the following files when loading the JSON-LD serializations, which are normative. Other semantically equivalent serializations of the vocabulary files MAY be used by implementations. A cryptographic hash is provided for each JSON-LD document to ensure that developers can verify that the content of each file is correct.

JSON-LD Documents and Hashes
URL: https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials#
Resolved Document: https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/index.jsonld
SHA2-256 Digest: 9db03c54d69a8ec3944f10770e342b33e58a79045c957c35d51285976fc467c4
URL: https://w3id.org/security#
Resolved Document: https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-integrity/vocab/security/vocabulary.jsonld
SHA2-256 Digest: 689af6f393b55c9b35c37cfad59d13cc421e0c89ce97cf0e8234f9b4a3074104

It is possible to confirm the cryptographic digests listed above by running a command like the following, replacing <DOCUMENT_URL> with the appropriate value, through a modern UNIX-like OS command line interface: curl -sL -H "Accept: application/ld+json" <DOCUMENT_URL> | openssl dgst -sha256

NOTE: schema.org changes regularly, but is considered stable

Implementers and document authors might note that cryptographic digests for schema.org are not provided. This is because the schema.org vocabulary undergoes regular changes; any digest provided would be out of date within weeks of publication. The Working Group discussed this concern and concluded that the vocabulary terms from schema.org, that are used by this specification, have been stable for years and are highly unlikely to change in their semantic meaning.

The following base classes are defined in this specification for processors and other specifications that benefit from such definitions:

Base Class	Purpose
CredentialEvidence	Serves as a superclass for specific evidence types that are placed into the evidence property.
CredentialSchema	Serves as a superclass for specific schema types that are placed into the credentialSchema property.
CredentialStatus	Serves as a superclass for specific credential status types that are placed into the credentialStatus property.
ConfidenceMethod	Serves as a superclass for specific confidence method types that are placed into the confidenceMethod property.
RefreshService	Serves as a superclass for specific refresh service types that are placed into the credentialRefresh property.
RenderMethod	Serves as a superclass for specific render method types that are placed into the renderMethod property.
TermsOfUse	Serves as a superclass for specific terms of use types that are placed into the termsOfUse property.
B.3 Datatypes

This section defines datatypes that are used by this specification.

B.3.1 The sriString Datatype

The sriString datatype is associated with a value to provide the integrity information for a resource using the method specified in the Subresource Integrity specification. The sriString datatype is defined as follows:

The URL denoting this datatype
https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials#sriString
The lexical space
See the ABNF grammar, defining the integrity attribute in the [SRI] specification, for the restrictions on the string format.
The value space
A (possibly empty) list of (alg,val) pairs, where alg identifies a hash function, and val is an integer as a standard mathematical concept.
The lexical-to-value mapping
Any element of the lexical space is mapped to the value space by following the parse metadata algorithm based on the ABNF grammar in the [SRI] specification.
The canonical mapping
The canonical mapping consists of the lexical-to-value mapping.
B.4 Differences between Contexts, Types, and CredentialSchemas

This section is non-normative.

The verifiable credential and verifiable presentation data models leverage a variety of underlying technologies including [JSON-LD11] and [VC-JSON-SCHEMA]. This section will provide a comparison of the @context, type, and credentialSchema properties, and cover some of the more specific use cases where it is possible to use these features of the data model.

The type property is used to uniquely identify the type of the verifiable credential in which it appears, that is, to indicate which set of claims the verifiable credential contains. This property, and the value VerifiableCredential within the set of its values, are mandatory. Whilst it is good practice to include one additional value depicting the unique subtype of this verifiable credential, it is permitted to either omit or include additional type values in the array. Many verifiers will request a verifiable credential of a specific subtype, then omitting the subtype value could make it more difficult for verifiers to inform the holder which verifiable credential they require. When a verifiable credential has multiple subtypes, listing all of them in the type property is sensible. The use of the type property in a [JSON-LD11] representation of a verifiable credential enables to enforce the semantics of the verifiable credential because the machine is able to check the semantics. With [JSON-LD11], the technology is not only describing the categorization of the set of claims, the technology is also conveying the structure and semantics of the sub-graph of the properties in the graph. In [JSON-LD11], this represents the type of the node in the graph which is why some [JSON-LD11] representations of a verifiable credential will use the type property on many objects in the verifiable credential.

The primary purpose of the @context property, from a [JSON-LD11] perspective, is to convey the meaning of the data and term definitions of the data in a verifiable credential, in a machine-readable way. The @context property is used to map the globally unique URLs for properties in verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations into short-form alias names, making [JSON-LD11] representations more human-friendly to read. From a [JSON-LD11] perspective, this mapping also allows the data in a credential to be modeled in a network of machine-readable data, by enhancing how the data in the verifiable credential or verifiable presentation relates to a larger machine-readable data graph. This is useful for telling machines how to relate the meaning of data to other data in an ecosystem where parties are unable to coordinate. This property, with the first value in the set being https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2, is mandatory.

Since the @context property is used to map data to a graph data model, and the type property in [JSON-LD11] is used to describe nodes within the graph, the type property becomes even more important when using the two properties in combination. For example, if the type property is not included within the resolved @context resource using [JSON-LD11], it could lead to claims being dropped and/or their integrity no longer being protected during production and consumption of the verifiable credential. Alternatively, it could lead to errors being raised during production or consumption of a verifiable credential. This will depend on the design choices of the implementation and both paths are used in implementations today, so it's important to pay attention to these properties when using a [JSON-LD11] representation of a verifiable credential or verifiable presentation.

The primary purpose of the credentialSchema property is to define the structure of the verifiable credential, and the datatypes for the values of each property that appears. A credentialSchema is useful for defining the contents and structure of a set of claims in a verifiable credential, whereas [JSON-LD11] and a @context in a verifiable credential are best used only for conveying the semantics and term definitions of the data, and can be used to define the structure of the verifiable credential as well.

While it is possible to use some [JSON-LD11] features to allude to the contents of the verifiable credential, it's not generally suggested to use @context to constrain the data types of the data model. For example, "@type": "@json" is useful for leaving the semantics open-ended and not strictly defined. This can be dangerous if the implementer is looking to constrain the data type of the claims in the credential, and is expected not to be used.

When the credentialSchema and @context properties are used in combination, both producers and consumers can be more confident about the expected contents and data types of the verifiable credential and verifiable presentation.

C. IANA Considerations

This section is non-normative.

This section will be submitted to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) for review, approval, and registration with IANA.

C.1 application/vc

This specification registers the application/vc media type specifically for identifying documents conforming to the verifiable credentials format.

Type name:	application
Subtype name:	vc
Required parameters:	None
Encoding considerations:	Resources that use the application/vc media type are required to conform to all of the requirements for the application/ld+json media type and are therefore subject to the same encoding considerations specified in Section 11 of The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format.
Security considerations:	As defined in the Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0.
Contact:	W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group public-vc-wg@w3.org

Note that while the verifiable credentials format uses JSON-LD conventions, there are a number of constraints and additional requirements for verifiable credential implementations that justify the use of a specific media type.

This media type can be used in an enveloping proof to denote the enveloped payload.

The credential is expected to be a valid JSON-LD document. Verifiable credentials served with the application/vc media type are expected to have all JSON-LD 1.1 context information, including references to external contexts, within the body of the document. Contexts linked via a http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context HTTP Link Header (see Section 6.1 of JSON-LD 1.1) are ignored.

C.2 application/vp

This specification registers the application/vp media type specifically for identifying documents conforming to the verifiable presentations format.

Type name:	application
Subtype name:	vp
Required parameters:	None
Encoding considerations:	Resources that use the application/vp media type are required to conform to all of the requirements for the application/ld+json media type and are therefore subject to the same encoding considerations specified in Section 11 of The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format.
Security considerations:	As defined in Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0.
Contact:	W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group public-vc-wg@w3.org

Note that while the verifiable presentations format uses JSON-LD conventions, there are a number of constraints and additional requirements for verifiable presentation implementations that justify the use of a specific media type.

This media type can be used in an enveloping proof to denote the enveloped payload.

The presentation is expected to be a valid JSON-LD document. Verifiable presentations served with the application/vp media type are expected to have all JSON-LD 1.1 context information, including references to external contexts, within the body of the document. Contexts linked via a http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context HTTP Link Header (see Section 6.1 of [JSON-LD11]) are ignored.

D. Additional Diagrams for Verifiable Presentations

This section is non-normative.

Figure 14 below is a variant of Figure 9: a verifiable presentation referring to two verifiable credentials, and using embedded proofs based on [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY]. Each verifiable credential graph is connected to its own separate proof graph; the verifiableCredential property is used to connect the verifiable presentation to the verifiable credential graphs. The presentation proof graph represents the digital signature of the verifiable presentation graph, both verifiable credential graphs, and the proof graphs linked from the verifiable credential graphs. The complete verifiable presentation consists, in this case, of six information graphs.

Figure 14 A variant of Figure 9: information graphs associated with a verifiable presentation referring to two verifiable credentials, using an embedded proof based on Verifiable Credential Data Integrity 1.0 [VC-DATA-INTEGRITY].

Figure 15 below shows the same verifiable presentation as Figure 14, but using an enveloping proof based on [VC-JOSE-COSE]. Each verifiable credential graph contains a single EnvelopedVerifiableCredential instance, referring, via a data: URL [RFC2397], to a verifiable credential secured via an enveloping proof.

Figure 15 A variant of Figure 10: information graphs associated with a verifiable presentation referring to two verifiable credentials using enveloping proofs based on JOSE [VC-JOSE-COSE].
