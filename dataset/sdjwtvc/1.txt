1.1.  Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model

   In the so-called Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, Issuers issue so-
   called Verifiable Credentials to a Holder, who can then present the
   Verifiable Credentials to Verifiers.  Verifiable Credentials are
   cryptographically signed statements about a Subject, typically the
   Holder.

    Figure 1: Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model with optional Status Provider

   Verifiers can check the authenticity of the data in the Verifiable
   Credentials and optionally enforce Key Binding, i.e., ask the Holder
   to prove that they are the intended holder of the Verifiable
   Credential, for example, by proving possession of a cryptographic key
   referenced in the credential.  This process is further described in
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   To support revocation of Verifiable Credentials, revocation
   information can optionally be retrieved from a Status Provider.  The
   role of a Status Provider can be fulfilled by either a fourth party
   or by the Issuer.

1.2.  SD-JWT as a Credential Format

   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519] can in principle be used to express
   Verifiable Credentials in a way that is easy to understand and
   process as it builds upon established web primitives.

   Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT)
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] is a specification that
   introduces conventions to support selective disclosure for JWTs: For
   an SD-JWT document, a Holder can decide which claims to release
   (within bounds defined by the Issuer).

   SD-JWT is a superset of JWT as it can also be used when there are no
   selectively disclosable claims and also supports JWS JSON
   serialization, which is useful for long term archiving and multi
   signatures.  However, SD-JWT itself does not define the claims that
   must be used within the payload or their semantics.

   This specification uses SD-JWT and the well-established JWT content
   rules and extensibility model as basis for representing Verifiable
   Credentials with JSON payloads.  These Verifiable Credentials are
   called SD-JWT VCs.  The use of selective disclosure in SD-JWT VCs is
   OPTIONAL.

   SD-JWTs VC can contain claims that are registered in "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry as defined in [RFC7519], as well as public and
   private claims.

   Note: This specification does not utilize the W3C's Verifiable
   Credentials Data Model v1.0, v1.1, or v2.0.

1.3.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

1.4.  Terms and Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Holder", "Issuer", "Verifier",
   "Key Binding JWT" defined by
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   Verifiable Credential (VC):  An Issuer-signed assertion with claims
      about a Subject.

   SD-JWT-based Verifiable Credential (SD-JWT VC):  A Verifiable

      Credential encoded using the format defined in
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  It may or may not
      contain selectively disclosable claims.

   Unsecured Payload of an SD-JWT VC:  A JSON object containing all
      selectively disclosable and non-selectively disclosable claims of
      the SD-JWT VC.  The Unsecured Payload acts as the input JSON
      object to issue an SD-JWT VC complying to this specification.

   Status Provider:  An entity that provides status information (e.g.
      revocation) about a Verifiable Credential.

2.  Scope

   *  This specification defines

      -  Data model and media types for Verifiable Credentials based on
         SD-JWTs.

      -  Validation and processing rules for Verifiers and Holders.

3.  Verifiable Credentials based on SD-JWT

   This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for
   SD-JWT VCs.

3.1.  Media Type

   SD-JWT VCs compliant with this specification MUST use the media type
   application/vc+sd-jwt as defined in Appendix A.2.1.

3.2.  Data Format

   SD-JWT VCs MUST be encoded using the SD-JWT format defined in
   Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  A
   presentation of an SD-JWT VC MAY contain a Key Binding JWT.

   Note that in some cases, an SD-JWT VC MAY have no selectively
   disclosable claims, and therefore the encoded SD-JWT will not contain
   any Disclosures.

3.2.1.  JOSE Header

   This section defines JWT header parameters for the SD-JWT component
   of the SD-JWT VC.

Internet-Draft                  SD-JWT VC                   October 2023


   The typ header parameter of the SD-JWT MUST be present.  The typ
   value MUST use vc+sd-jwt.  This indicates that the payload of the SD-
   JWT contains plain JSON and follows the rules as defined in this
   specification.  It further indicates that the SD-JWT is a SD-JWT
   component of a SD-JWT VC.

   The following is a non-normative example of a decoded SD-JWT header:

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "typ": "vc+sd-jwt"
   }

3.2.2.  JWT Claims Set

   This section defines the claims that can be included in the payload
   of SD-JWT VCs.

3.2.2.1.  New JWT Claims

3.2.2.1.1.  Verifiable Credential Type - vct Claim

   This specification defines the JWT claim vct (for verifiable
   credential type).  The vct value MUST be a case-sensitive StringOrURI
   (see [RFC7519]) value serving as an identifier for the type of the
   SD-JWT VC.  The vct value MUST be a Collision-Resistant Name as
   defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515].

   A type is associated with rules defining which claims may or must
   appear in the Unsecured Payload of the SD-JWT VC and whether they
   may, must, or must not be selectively disclosable.  This
   specification does not define any vct values; instead it is expected
   that ecosystems using SD-JWT VCs define such values including the
   semantics of the respective claims and associated rules (e.g.,
   policies for issuing and validating credentials beyond what is
   defined in this specification).

   The following is a non-normative example of how vct is used to
   express a type:

   {
     "vct": "https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential"
   }

   For example, a value of https://credentials.example.com/
   identity_credential can be associated with rules that define that at
   least the registered JWT claims given_name, family_name, birthdate,
   and address must appear in the Unsecured Payload.  Additionally, the

   registered JWT claims email and phone_number, and the private claims
   is_over_18, is_over_21, and is_over_65 may be used.  The type might
   also indicate that any of the aforementioned claims can be
   selectively disclosable.

3.2.2.2.  Registered JWT Claims

   SD-JWT VCs MAY use any claim registered in the "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry as defined in [RFC7519].

   If present, the following registered JWT claims MUST be included in
   the SD-JWT and MUST NOT be included in the Disclosures, i.e. cannot
   be selectively disclosed:

   *  iss

      -  REQUIRED.  The Issuer of the Verifiable Credential.  The value
         of iss MUST be a URI.  See [RFC7519] for more information.

   *  iat

      -  REQUIRED.  The time of issuance of the Verifiable Credential.
         See [RFC7519] for more information.

   *  nbf

      -  OPTIONAL.  The time before which the Verifiable Credential MUST
         NOT be accepted before validating.  See [RFC7519] for more
         information.

   *  exp

      -  OPTIONAL.  The expiry time of the Verifiable Credential after
         which the Verifiable Credential is no longer valid.  See
         [RFC7519] for more information.

   *  cnf

      -  REQUIRED when Cryptographic Key Binding is to be supported.
         Contains the confirmation method as defined in [RFC7800].  It
         is RECOMMENDED that this contains a JWK as defined in
         Section 3.2 of [RFC7800].  For Cryptographic Key Binding, the
         Key Binding JWT in the Combined Format for Presentation MUST be
         signed by the key identified in this claim.

   *  vct

Internet-Draft                  SD-JWT VC                   October 2023


      -  REQUIRED.  The type of the Verifiable Credential, e.g.,
         https://credentials.example.com/identity_credential, as defined
         in Section 3.2.2.1.1.

   *  status

      -  OPTIONAL.  The information on how to read the status of the
         Verifiable Credential.  See
         [I-D.looker-oauth-jwt-cwt-status-list] for more information.

   The following registered JWT claims MAY be contained in the SD-JWT or
   in the Disclosures and MAY be selectively disclosed:

   *  sub

      -  OPTIONAL.  The identifier of the Subject of the Verifiable
         Credential.  The Issuer MAY use it to provide the Subject
         identifier known by the Issuer.  There is no requirement for a
         binding to exist between sub and cnf claims.

3.2.2.3.  Public JWT claims

   Additional public claims MAY be used in SD-JWT VCs depending on the
   application.

3.2.2.4.  SD-JWT VC without Selectively Disclosable Claims

   An SD-JWT VC MAY have no selectively disclosable claims.  In that
   case, the SD-JWT VC MUST NOT contain the _sd claim in the JWT body.
   It also MUST NOT have any Disclosures.

3.3.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of an unsecured payload of
   an SD-JWT VC.

3.4.  Verification and Processing

   The recipient (Holder or Verifier) of an SD-JWT VC MUST process and
   verify an SD-JWT VC as described in Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   If Key Binding is required (refer to the security considerations in
   Section 11.6 of [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt]), the
   Verifier MUST verify the Key Binding JWT according to Section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].  To verify the Key Binding
   JWT, the cnf claim of the SD-JWT MUST be used.

   Furthermore, the recipient of the SD-JWT VC MUST obtain the public
   verification key for the Issuer-signed JWT as defined in Section 3.5.

   If there are no selectively disclosable claims, there is no need to
   process the _sd claim nor any Disclosures.

   If status is present in the verified payload of the SD-JWT, the
   status SHOULD be checked.  It depends on the Verifier policy to
   reject or accept a presentation of a SD-JWT VC based on the status of
   the Verifiable Credential.

   Any claims used that are not understood MUST be ignored.

   Additional validation rules MAY apply, but their use is out of the
   scope of this specification.

3.5.  Obtaining Public Key for Issuer-signed JWTs

   A recipient of an SD-JWT VC MUST apply the following rules to obtain
   the public verification key for the Issuer-signed JWT:

   *  JWT Issuer Metadata: If the iss value contains an HTTPS URI, the
      recipient MUST obtain the public key using JWT Issuer Metadata as
      defined in Section 4.

   *  DID Document Resolution: If the iss value contains a DID
      [W3C.DID], the recipient MUST retrieve the public key from the DID
      Document resolved from the DID in the iss value.  In this case, if
      the kid JWT header parameter is present, the kid MUST be a
      relative or absolute DID URL of the DID in the iss value,
      identifying the public key.

   *  X.509 Certificates: The recipient MUST obtain the public key from
      the leaf X.509 certificate defined by the x5c, x5c, or x5t JWT
      header parameters of the Issuer-signed JWT and validate the X.509
      certificate chain in the following cases:

      -  If the iss value contains a DNS name encoded as a URI using the
         DNS URI scheme [RFC4501].  In this case, the DNS name MUST
         match a dNSName Subject Alternative Name (SAN) [RFC5280] entry
         of the leaf certificate.

      -  If the iss value contains a URN using the URN URI scheme
         [RFC2141].  In this case, the URN MUST match a
         unifiedResourceName SAN entry of the leaf certificate.

   Separate specifications or ecosystem regulations MAY define rules
   complementing the rules defined above, but such rules are out of
   scope of this specification.  See Section 6.2 for security
   considerations.

4.  JWT Issuer Metadata

   This specification defines the JWT Issuer Metadata to retrieve the
   JWT Issuer Metadata configuration of the JWT Issuer of the JWT.  The
   JWT Issuer is identified by the iss claim in the JWT.  Use of the JWT
   Issuer Metadata is OPTIONAL.

   JWT Issuers publishing JWT Issuer Metadata MUST make a JWT Issuer
   Metadata configuration available at the path formed by concatenating
   the string /.well-known/jwt-issuer to the iss claim value in the JWT.
   The iss MUST be a case-sensitive URL using the HTTPS scheme that
   contains scheme, host and, optionally, port number and path
   components, but no query or fragment components.

4.1.  JWT Issuer Metadata Request

   A JWT Issuer Metadata configuration MUST be queried using an HTTP GET
   request at the path defined in Section 4.

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the
   JWT Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://example.com:

   GET /.well-known/jwt-issuer HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   If the iss value contains a path component, any terminating / MUST be
   removed before inserting /.well-known/ and the well-known URI suffix
   between the host component and the path component.

   The following is a non-normative example of a HTTP request for the
   JWT Issuer Metadata configuration when iss is set to
   https://example.com/user/1234:

   GET /.well-known/jwt-issuer/user/1234 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

4.2.  JWT Issuer Metadata Response

   A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP and return the JWT
   Issuer Metadata configuration using the application/json content
   type.

   An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

   This specification defines the following JWT Issuer Metadata
   configuration parameters:

   *  issuer REQUIRED.  The JWT Issuer identifier, which MUST be
      identical to the iss value in the JWT.

   *  jwks_uri

      -  OPTIONAL.  URL string referencing the JWT Issuer's JSON Web Key
         (JWK) Set [RFC7517] document which contains the JWT Issuer's
         public keys.  The value of this field MUST point to a valid JWK
         Set document.

   *  jwks

      -  OPTIONAL.  JWT Issuer's JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517] document
         value, which contains the JWT Issuer's public keys.  The value
         of this field MUST be a JSON object containing a valid JWK Set.

   JWT Issuer Metadata MUST include either jwks_uri or jwks in their JWT
   Issuer Metadata, but not both.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the JWT contains a kid JWT header parameter
   that can be used to lookup the public key in the JWK Set included by
   value or referenced in the JWT Issuer Metadata.

   The following is a non-normative example of a JWT Issuer Metadata
   configuration including jwks:

   {
      "issuer":"https://example.com",
      "jwks":{
         "keys":[
            {

      "jwks_uri":"https://jwt-issuer.example.org/my_public_keys.jwks"
   }

   Additional JWT Issuer Metadata configuration parameters MAY also be
   used.

4.3.  JWT Issuer Metadata Validation

   The issuer value returned MUST be identical to the iss value of the
   JWT.  If these values are not identical, the data contained in the
   response MUST NOT be used.

5.  Presenting Verifiable Credentials

   This section defines encoding, validation and processing rules for
   presentations of SD-JWT VCs.

5.1.  Key Binding JWT

   If the presentation of the SD-JWT VC includes a Key Binding JWT, the
   Key Binding JWT MUST adhere to the rules defined in Section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt].

   The Key Binding JWT MAY include addtional claims which, when not
   understood, MUST be ignored by the Verifier.

5.2.  Examples

   The following is a non-normative example of a presentation of the SD-
   JWT shown above including a Key Binding JWT:

6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations in the SD-JWT specification
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply to this
   specification.  Additionally, the following security considerations
   need to be taken into account when using SD-JWT VCs:

6.1.  Server-Side Request Forgery

   The JWT Issuer Metadata configuration is retrieved from the JWT
   Issuer by the Holder or Verifier.  Similar to other metadata
   endpoints, the URL for the retrieval MUST be considered an untrusted
   value and could be a vector for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   attacks.

   Before making a request to the JWT Issuer Metadata endpoint, the
   Holder or Verifier MUST validate the URL to ensure that it is a valid
   HTTPS URL and that it does not point to internal resources.  This
   requires, in particular, ensuring that the host part of the URL does
   not address an internal service (by IP address or an internal host
   name) and that, if an external DNS name is used, the resolved DNS
   name does not point to an internal IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   When retrieving the metadata, the Holder or Verifier MUST ensure that
   the request is made in a time-bound and size-bound manner to prevent
   denial of service attacks.  The Holder or Verifier MUST also ensure
   that the response is a valid JWT Issuer Metadata configuration
   document before processing it.

   Additional considerations can be found in [OWASP_SSRF].

6.2.  Ecosystem-specific Public Key Verification Methods

   When defining ecosystem-specific rules for the verification of the
   public key, as outlined in Section 3.5, it is critical that those
   rules maintain the integrity of the relationship between the iss
   value within the Issuer-signed JWT and the public keys of the Issuer.

   It MUST be ensured that for any given iss value, an attacker cannot
   influence the type of verification process used.  Otherwise, an
   attacker could attempt to make the Verifier use a verification
   process not intended by the Issuer, allowing the attacker to
   potentially manipulate the verification result to their advantage.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   The Privacy Considerations in the SD-JWT specification
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply to this
   specification.  Additionally, the following privacy considerations
   need to be taken into account when using SD-JWT VCs.

7.1.  Unlinkability

   The Privacy Considerations in Section 12.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt] apply especially to the cnf
   claim.

7.2.  Verifiable Credential Type Identifier

   Issuers and Holders have to be aware that while this specification
   supports selective disclosure of claims of a given SD-JWT VC, the vct
   claim is not selectively disclosable.  In certain situations this
   could lead to unwanted leakage of additional context information.

   In general, Issuers are advised to choose vct values following data
   minimization principles.  For example, government Issuers issuing an
   SD-JWT VC to their citizens to enable them to prove their age, might
   consider using a vct value that does not allow third-parties to infer
   additional personal information about the Holder, e.g., country of
   residency or citizenship.

   Additionally, Holders have to be informed that, besides the actual
   requested claims, the vct information is shared with the Verifier.

7.3.  Issuer Phone-Home

   A malicious Issuer can choose the Issuer identifier of the SD-JWT VC
   to enable tracking the usage behavior of the Holder if the Issuer
   identifier is Holder-specific and if the resolution of the key
   material to verify the Issuer-signed JWT requires the Verifier to
   phone home to the Issuer.

   For example, a malicious Issuer could generate a unique value for the
   Issuer identifier per Holder, e.g., https://example.com/issuer/
   holder-1234 and host the JWT Issuer Metadata.  The Verifier would
   create a HTTPS GET request to the Holder-specific well-known URI when
   the SD-JWT VC is verified.  This would allow the malicious Issuer to
   keep track where and how often the SD-JWT VC was used.

Internet-Draft                  SD-JWT VC                   October 2023


   Verifiers are advised to establish trust in an SD-JWT VC by pinning
   specific Issuer identifiers and should monitor suspicious behaviour
   such as frequently rotating Issuer identifiers.  If such behaviour
   was detected, Verifiers are advised to reject SD-JWT VCs issued by
   such Issuers.

   Holders are advised to reject SD-JWT VCs if they contain easily
   correlatable information in the Issuer identifier.
